This one is pretty nice and simple to set up and with easy instructions illustrated on the back of the box (not sure why some reviewers have stated that there are no instructions when they are clearly printed on the box unless they received different packaging than I did). Once assembled, the pairing via bluetooth and use of the stick are easy and intuitive. Nothing to it.<br /><br />The stick comes with a USB charging cable but arrived with a charge so you can use it immediately, though it’s probably a good idea to charge it right away so that you have no interruption of use out of the box. Make sure the stick is switched to on (it will light up) and extend your stick to the length you desire up to about a yard’s length and snap away.<br /><br />The phone clamp held the phone sturdily so I wasn’t worried about it slipping out. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver.  But that will happen with any stick and is not specific to this one in particular.<br /><br />Two things that could improve this: 1) add the option to clamp this in portrait orientation instead of having to try and hold the stick at the portrait angle, which makes it feel unstable; 2) add the opening for a tripod so that this can be used to sit upright on a table for skyping and facetime eliminating the need to hold the phone up with your hand, causing fatigue.<br /><br />But other than that, this is a nice quality monopod for a variety of picture taking opportunities.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion.\t2015-08-31\n",

A full charge will last you at least three days. It's going to take a couple charging cycles for the phone to recognize the battery fully and you won't have to panic and rush for a charger at one percent either. 1% of a 10000 mah battery is another 5 hrs. Just try not to constantly run the battery down to 0.\",\n",

My battery was swollen to the point where my screen was raising and my battery was dying so fast but this battery got rid of those issues!<br />It came fully charged and having only one cycle. This battery works great! It now works as though it's brand new! Thank you!<br />Would definitely recommend 🙌🏽\",\n",
              " 'This is not my first smart watch but it is the best.  First of all, it does everything it says it will do.  The dial display is by far the best.  Bright and easy to read.  I move my wrist and the dial lights up.  Once the app apk is downloaded to my phone they are joined at the hip.  I mean every notice or alert to the phone also goes to the watch.  You can choose which alerts you want or want to block.  Remote access is perfect.  The video camera from the watch works but may take a little practice.  The build and quality of the watch is outstanding and looks more expensive than it costs.  This is a great watch and I am very glad I bought it.  There might be one negative, the leather band could be a little larger.  My wrist is of average size and the band fits but is a little snug.  The band looks great and does the job.  Personally I would prefer a adjustable butterfly clasp and will look into it.  This is a good smart watch.',\n",

Plus the actual capacity of another new 5s battery from iFixit was 1500mAh and this battery was 1360mAH. the design capacity are both 1550mAh. Very disappointed that liar sellers are on Amazon as this is a scam!',\n",
              " \"Recently I purchased three very similar products just for testing. They are:<br />- [[ASIN:B00FGN1OBU MoKo [Fit-Charge] 9000mAh Portable External Battery Charger]] (this product)<br />- [[ASIN:B00JPLTM3Q SUNYEE (Lifeform) 8400mAh power bank]], and<br />- [[ASIN:B00EP6OJ48 RAVPower 8400mAh power bank]]<br /><br />Externally, all three products look nearly identical (see the product picture I uploaded). They all come with dual USB ports, a 4-segment battery status indicator, a small LED passing as flashlight, etc. They have nearly identical dimensions and similar weights. According to my electronic kitchen scale:<br />RavPower unit = 182g; Lifeform = 189g; MOKO = 197g<br /><br />Internally, however, they are quite different. The Moko unit is definitely the best based on my testing.<br /><br />[Output Current]<br />The Moko unit comes with two identical USB ports. I can recharge my [[ASIN:B00AGAYQEU B&N NOOK HD+ Tablet]] at full speed (1.95A) from either port. The maximum total output current is around 3.2A, according to my load test.<br /><br />The other two power banks both have two ports labeled `1A' and `2A' respectively. But I can only charge my Nook at 1A from the first  port, 0.45A from the second. Their total output current are both limited to just around 2A.<br /><br />[Output Energy]<br />In my battery capacity test, the Moko unit is able to sustain 1.9A at about 5.1V for 181 minutes. This corresponds to a total output energy higher than that by other two units:<br />- Lifeform: 25Wh<br />- RavPower: 26Wh<br />- Moko: 29.5Wh<br /><br />[Battery Status Indicator]<br />None of the products' status indicators are completely linear. That means you cannot interpret one LED out of four as 25% capacity. But the Moko unit comes closest:<br /><br />4-LED: 80 to 100%<br />3-LED: 65 to 79%<br />2-LED: 40 to 65%<br />1-LED: 3 to 39%<br />Blinking: under 2%<br /><br />[Accessories]<br />Here the Moko unit comes up short. There is just one short USB cable in the box. No adapters, pouches, etc.<br /><br />[Bottom Line]<br />Electrically, the Moko unit offers the best performance in every category I tested. Price-wise, the Moko unit is currently positioned right in the middle between Lifeform (highest) and RavPower (lowest). So I definitely recommend getting this Moko product over the other two brands.<br /><br />[Update on Aug 31, 2015]<br />I should mention that the Moko unit supports pass-thru charging. That means it can continue to power USB devices even while its internal battery is being recharged. This feature is not available on most higher-capacity power banks such as the [[ASIN:B00LRK8JDC AmazonBasics PB10]].<br /><br />[Update on Oct 18, 2015]<br />I have been using the Moko unit in my car as a 'buffer charger'. It serves the purpose perfectly because:<br />1. It allows pass-thru charging of two USB devices from one USB port in the car<br />2. It starts charging automatically whenever an USB device is connected<br />3. It enables my GPS unit to function without interruption even when the car's engine is off<br />4. It can be used as an emergency flashlight if needed.<br /><br />[Update on Mar 13, 2016]<br />Uploaded a picture showing some of my favorite power banks of various capacities: [[ASIN:B00LRK8JDC AmazonBasics 10,000mAh]], [[ASIN:B00FGN1OBU MoKo 9000mAh]], [[ASIN:B00GRQ8AQM KMAX-812 4400mAh]], and [[ASIN:B013W3FW6S TYLT 3200mAh]].apters, pouches, etc.<br /><br />[Bottom Line]<br />Electrically, the Moko unit offers the best performance in every category I tested.

              " \"I know someone said their IPhone 6 is only getting one charge, but that's not my experience.<br /><br />Got two of these.  On for my wife and one for myself.  Have used it while wandering about heavily on my phone (think watching a video for two hours) and kept my phone at 100% (Nexus 5).  It's super light compared to the 15,000mah battery I've had and the whole time I had it in my pocket and didn't even notice it.  It's really about the size and weight of the average 5&#34; smartphone (except for the latest iPhone 6 and Samsung S6). This battery is the  tiniest bit heavier than. The Galaxy S6 by I think 3 oz.<br /><br />To put the weight into something easier to visualize.  This battery is a little heavier than one Galaxy S6.  Ya gotta gold them and really try to feel the difference.<br /><br />My 15,000mah battery was like holding 6 Galaxy 6S phones.  Uh.  There's a huge difference I size.  I highly recommend looking at the weight of this battery and comapring it to the size and weight of your current battery.<br /><br />But so far, the 20,000 mah capacity seems accurate.  The 2.1amp output charges quickly like a 2.1 should.  Really enjoying this battery so far.<br /><br />And on that point...  Thank you!  Having ports labeled output 1 and output 2 is annoying.  This battery has the ports labeled Out 1A and Out 2.1A.  Thank you very much for having the amps labeled on the ports.  *high 5*<br /><br />PS:  My old battery was the KMASHI 15,000mah battery (red and black)\",\n",
              " \"[[VIDEOID:dfb94a2d29e84e1122001d21b610ff4f]] I bought this unit in the hopes that it would be a more portable version of a larger unit (11000mah) I already own.  The Ravpower unit provides 3000mah and in my testing it provides that amount of power, which is enough to charge a large phone with one full charge.<br /><br />I did more testing off camera with Android and iPad tablets and all charged either the same or more than the power provided by the manufacturers.  This means that this Ravpower device will provide you a quicker charge while out and about than you would get from plugging into the wall at home.  This is a key feature of these portable chargers that isn't to be overlooked.<br /><br />Here are some test highlights from the video.  This is a physically small power supply it can provide the full rating of 1A at 5V when charging an iPhone and more than the Android phone I tested in the video.  It can also deliver slightly more than 1A when charging multiple devices.  I don't mention it in the video but it's actually a good sign that they don't go as hight in the Amperage as the other device I tested, it means they are properly controlling the power as part of their circuit design.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Provides the rated capacity<br />Provides up to and slightly over power rating<br />Included flat USB cable is great, nice touch<br />Color options are great<br />Power button is a nice touch (some other units as the other one in the video don't include this)<br />Fast charging of the internal battery, it charges at the same rate it provides power, 1A<br /><br />Cons:<br />The power button is small and hard to push when power is plugged in<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this device, well worth the money!\",\n",
              " \"Almost every review I saw from it had the disclaimer that they were given the product at a discount. That was almost the deciding factor to NOT get this product. I was worried that this product wasn't as good as its' rating because of these discounts. But I decided that I can be one of the reviews that determine if these guys were paid for the review, or it really was just a good product. So I bought one and gave it a try.<br /><br />This product was bought because it was a bit cheaper than a similar alternative that is on amazon, and it really is a great product, especially for the price The battery time does last a long time. One of my concerns was that while charging your phone, and the phone becomes full, it will keep trying to charge at full speed and die quickly, but that wasn't the case. One my phone was full, the rate that it lost power became a trickle of its' former self.<br /><br />The battery indicator does exactly what it needs to, and although you don't know how much exactly it has left in it, for the price your paying, it shouldn't be expected. Casing for this product seems to be durable, and aesthetically pleasing, though I haven't yet dropped it from a high height, so I can't comment on durability too much.<br /><br />After all this, I only had a single problem, which normally should warrant it going down to 4 stars (barely) but because of great customer service, it remains 5 stars. After only a couple of weeks, the charging cord that came with it started to fray at the end of the cable. Where the USB meets the cable, the white protecting sheath came apart a bit and you could see the actual electrical cables. Still worked, but when that happens, you know your cable is on life support.<br /><br />A couple of days later, I get an email from Jeff, the CEO(?) of Viivant. He asked how I was liking the product, and if there was anything he can help. I told  him about the cable, and he just asked for a picture, but even before sending him the photo, he wasdouble checking my address to send the new cable.

              "'A great battery for a great phone. Some of us power users need more than the standard and this is perfect. There isn\\'t a bigger battery on the market. A full charge will last you at least three days. It\\'s going to take a couple charging cycles for the phone to recognize the battery fully and you won\\'t have to panic and rush for a charger at one percent either. 1% of a 10000 mah battery is another 5 hrs. Just try not to constantly run the battery down to 0.\\nThis is the best Smartwatch i never seen... I recommend everyone who have a iphone to buy this Smartwatch......You can see everything notifications text messages you can answer phone calls . you can take picture from the watch you can video record too its awesome\\nSearched so long for a good working battery and believe me I\\'ve found one! This one! My battery was swollen to the point where my screen was raising and my battery was dying so fast but this battery got rid of those issues!It came fully charged and having only one cycle. This battery works great! It now works as though it\\'s brand new! Thank you!Would definitely recommend 🙌🏽\\nThis is not my first smart watch but it is the best.  First of all, it does everything it says it will do.  The dial display is by far the best.  Bright and easy to read.  I move my wrist and the dial lights up.  Once the app apk is downloaded to my phone they are joined at the hip.  I mean every notice or alert to the phone also goes to the watch.  You can choose which alerts you want or want to block.  Remote access is perfect.  The video camera from the watch works but may take a little practice.  The build and quality of the watch is outstanding and looks more expensive than it costs.  This is a great watch and I am very glad I bought it.  There might be one negative, the leather band could be a little larger.  My wrist is of average size and the band fits but is a little snug.  The band looks great and does the job.  Personally I would prefer a adjustable butterfly clasp and will look into it.  This is a good smart watch.\\nI feel like this is and was a scam and Amazon did not allow me to post a bad review with 1 Star, so changed this to 5 stars and edited my text. So...Expecting a new 5s battery and no way Jose! It has had 288 cycle charges before me!! Plus the actual capacity of another new 5s battery from iFixit was 1500mAh and this battery was 1360mAH. the design capacity are both 1550mAh. Very disappointed that liar sellers are on Amazon as this is a scam!\\nRecently I purchased three very similar products just for testing. They are:- [[ASIN:B00FGN1OBU MoKo [Fit-Charge] 9000mAh Portable External Battery Charger]] (this product)- [[ASIN:B00JPLTM3Q SUNYEE (Lifeform) 8400mAh power bank]], and- [[ASIN:B00EP6OJ48 RAVPower 8400mAh power bank]]Externally, all three products look nearly identical (see the product picture I uploaded). They all come with dual USB ports, a 4-segment battery status indicator, a small LED passing as flashlight, etc. They have nearly identical dimensions and similar weights. According to my electronic kitchen scale:RavPower unit = 182g; Lifeform = 189g; MOKO = 197gInternally, however, they are quite different. The Moko unit is definitely the best based on my testing.[Output Current]The Moko unit comes with two identical USB ports. I can recharge my [[ASIN:B00AGAYQEU B&N NOOK HD+ Tablet]] at full speed (1.95A) from either port. The maximum total output current is around 3.2A, according to my load test.The other two power banks both have two ports labeled `1A\\' and `2A\\' respectively. But I can only charge my Nook at 1A from the first  port, 0.45A from the second. Their total output current are both limited to just around 2A.[Output Energy]In my battery capacity test, the Moko unit is able to sustain 1.9A at about 5.1V for 181 minutes. This corresponds to a total output energy higher than that by other two units:- Lifeform: 25Wh- RavPower: 26Wh- Moko: 29.5Wh[Battery Status Indicator]None of the products\\' status indicators are completely linear. That means you cannot interpret one LED out of four as 25% capacity. But the Moko unit comes closest:4-LED: 80 to 100%3-LED: 65 to 79%2-LED: 40 to 65%1-LED: 3 to 39%Blinking: under 2%[Accessories]Here the Moko unit comes up short. There is just one short USB cable in the box. No adapters, pouches, etc.[Bottom Line]Electrically, the Moko unit offers the best performance in every category I tested. Price-wise, the Moko unit is currently positioned right in the middle between Lifeform (highest) and RavPower (lowest). So I definitely recommend getting this Moko product over the other two brands.[Update on Aug 31, 2015]I should mention that the Moko unit supports pass-thru charging. That means it can continue to power USB devices even while its internal battery is being recharged. This feature is not available on most higher-capacity power banks such as the [[ASIN:B00LRK8JDC AmazonBasics PB10]].[Update on Oct 18, 2015]I have been using the Moko unit in my car as a \\'buffer charger\\'. It serves the purpose perfectly because:1. It allows pass-thru charging of two USB devices from one USB port in the car2. It starts charging automatically whenever an USB device is connected3. It enables my GPS unit to function without interruption even when the car\\'s engine is off4. It can be used as an emergency flashlight if needed.[Update on Mar 13, 2016]Uploaded a picture showing some of my favorite power banks of various capacities: [[ASIN:B00LRK8JDC AmazonBasics 10,000mAh]], [[ASIN:B00FGN1OBU MoKo 9000mAh]], [[ASIN:B00GRQ8AQM KMAX-812 4400mAh]], and [[ASIN:B013W3FW6S TYLT 3200mAh]].apters, pouches, etc.[Bottom Line]Electrically, the Moko unit offers the best performance in every category I tested.

The battery had 5 cycles and is brand new. Time 10 minutes.Package is nice and very protective. will buy again\\nI know someone said their IPhone 6 is only getting one charge, but that\\'s not my experience.Got two of these.  On for my wife and one for myself.  Have used it while wandering about heavily on my phone (think watching a video for two hours) and kept my phone at 100% (Nexus 5).  It\\'s super light compared to the 15,000mah battery I\\'ve had and the whole time I had it in my pocket and didn\\'t even notice it.  It\\'s really about the size and weight of the average 5&#34; smartphone (except for the latest iPhone 6 and Samsung S6). This battery is the  tiniest bit heavier than. The Galaxy S6 by I think 3 oz.To put the weight into something easier to visualize.  This battery is a little heavier than one Galaxy S6.  Ya gotta gold them and really try to feel the difference.My 15,000mah battery was like holding 6 Galaxy 6S phones.  Uh.  There\\'s a huge difference I size.  I highly recommend looking at the weight of this battery and comapring it to the size and weight of your current battery.But so far, the 20,000 mah capacity seems accurate.  The 2.1amp output charges quickly like a 2.1 should.  Really enjoying this battery so far.And on that point...  Thank you!  Having ports labeled output 1 and output 2 is annoying.  This battery has the ports labeled Out 1A and Out 2.1A.  Thank you very much for having the amps labeled on the ports.  *high 5*PS:  My old battery was the KMASHI 15,000mah battery (red and black)\\n I bought this unit in the hopes that it would be a more portable version of a larger unit (11000mah) I already own.  The Ravpower unit provides 3000mah and in my testing it provides that amount of power, which is enough to charge a large phone with one full charge.I did more testing off camera with Android and iPad tablets and all charged either the same or more than the power provided by the manufacturers.  This means that this Ravpower device will provide you a quicker charge while out and about than you would get from plugging into the wall at home.  This is a key feature of these portable chargers that isn\\'t to be overlooked.Here are some test highlights from the video.  This is a physically small power supply it can provide the full rating of 1A at 5V when charging an iPhone and more than the Android phone I tested in the video.  It can also deliver slightly more than 1A when charging multiple devices.  I don\\'t mention it in the video but it\\'s actually a good sign that they don\\'t go as hight in the Amperage as the other device I tested, it means they are properly controlling the power as part of their circuit design.Pro:Provides the rated capacityProvides up to and slightly over power ratingIncluded flat USB cable is great, nice touchColor options are greatPower button is a nice touch (some other units as the other one in the video don\\'t include this)Fast charging of the internal battery, it charges at the same rate it provides power, 1ACons:The power button is small and hard to push when power is plugged inOverall, I would highly recommend this device, well worth the money!\\nAlmost every review I saw from it had the disclaimer that they were given the product at a discount. That was almost the deciding factor to NOT get this product. I was worried that this product wasn\\'t as good as its\\' rating because of these discounts. But I decided that I can be one of the reviews that determine if these guys were paid for the review, or it really was just a good product. So I bought one and gave it a try.This product was bought because it was a bit cheaper than a similar alternative that is on amazon, and it really is a great product, especially for the price The battery time does last a long time. One of my concerns was that while charging your phone, and the phone becomes full, it will keep trying to charge at full speed and die quickly, but that wasn\\'t the case. One my phone was full, the rate that it lost power became a trickle of its\\' former self.The battery indicator does exactly what it needs to, and although you don\\'t know how much exactly it has left in it, for the price your paying, it shouldn\\'t be expected. Casing for this product seems to be durable, and aesthetically pleasing, though I haven\\'t yet dropped it from a high height, so I can\\'t comment on durability too much.After all this, I only had a single problem, which normally should warrant it going down to 4 stars (barely) but because of great customer service, it remains 5 stars. After only a couple of weeks, the charging cord that came with it started to fray at the end of the cable. Where the USB meets the cable, the white protecting sheath came apart a bit and you could see the actual electrical cables. Still worked, but when that happens, you know your cable is on life support.A couple of days later, I get an email from Jeff, the CEO(?) of Viivant. He asked how I was liking the product, and if there was anything he can help. I told  him about the cable, and he just asked for a picture, but even before sending him the photo, he wasdouble checking my address to send the new cable. Apparently they are switching providers to get a better cable, which if it\\'s true, that fixes my only problem I had.Jeff was nice, super professional, and made already pretty good product great with amazing customer service.So yeah, this product is worth it.

It fits nicely in my purse so I can take it with me. It\\'s incredibly hassle-free and I\\'m very happy with my product!!\\nUpdate 18 months later:It lasted for about 9 months with good capacity, after a year, it added roughly 3 hours of battery life... and started \\'whistling\\' a high-pitch whine whenever a charger is plugged in - to be clear: I use ALL ANKER chargers and cables only with my iPhone - earlier this I realized my phone isn\\'t lasting longer than the original battery did and actually charges only 15% of my battery if the iPhone\\'s battery is 5%... and this case would start doing strange behavior: no longer was i able to plug in a charger because the case would STOP charging the phone, and actually shut off - this is abnormal behavior for this case which is by default - always on. So my phone would die and I\\'d turn the case on realizing it was off, and it\\'d start draining down, and the lights would turn off and on by themselves, just sitting stationary. often it would turn off by itself while charging. So I took the case off, and started charging normally - and my iPhone no longer charges properly, i can\\'t say if it\\'s normal iPhone 6 happenstance or if the battery case excacerbated or caused the problem... until today when my iPhone now won\\'t charge at all.I tried the case on a friend\\'s iPhone 6 and it\\'s doing the same \\'new\\' behavior - where when you plug a microUSB into it, it goes into it\\'s own charging state, and stops charging the iPhone, when you unplug it it turns itself on, and then will shut itself off without finishing charging or doing much to the iPhone. I should have stopped using it when i started to notice the high pitched whine, but it was past it\\'s warranty by then; just a word of caution - if you hear a sound from a battery - something is wrong. stop using it. again - i can\\'t assign blame to Anker or their product, but it\\'s no longer the product it was, there\\'s no physical damage, and it doesn\\'t work anymore, and possibly fried my iPhone\\'s ability to charge. (as in - my iPhone shows a black screen with the charging battery whenever the case is on or a charger is plugged in, and no longer powers the phone) if you\\'re reading this Anker: i love your products, and I\\'d like to keep buying them - I have many chargers, car bluetooth adapters, usb cables, external batteries and a mouse and I love them all - i hope this isn\\'t a quality issue.First things first,The Bad:• It comes with a 1ft microUSB cable, it is black - it is of good quality as ANKER\\'s cables are, with the same name stamp and texture as most of their other cables, but it’s only 1 foot long, so if you’re like me you’ll want a long one, they’re everywhere and Anker’s own microUSB cables are really good quality and don’t fall apart like some of the dirt cheap ones.• The MicroUSB port is a microUSB port:  iphone owners enjoy the lignting connector that is nearly zero fuss, you just stick it in; microUSB however needs to be right-side-up and it\\'s extremely delicate (compared to the all-metal lighnting connector) so you can\\'t force it, I experienced a problem where wiggling the included microusb cord in the case made it go from charge to not charge to &#34;This accessory is not supported&#34;. Keep in mind, the case is MFI certified, but the wiggling freaks it out.• To turn it off you have to hold down the power button for 5 whole seconds, this wouldn\\'t be an issue if it didn\\'t turn \\'on\\' every time you plug it in to charge; but there’s good reason for it’s functionality and you’ll get used to it.• The blue LEDs on back stay ON the entire time you are using the case actively to power/charge your phone, AND stay on the entire time it\\'s plugged into USB. This can be both distracting and annoying, especially somewhere like a movie theater or at night when you\\'re trying to sleep (e.g. i put my phone face down, and it makes huge blue spotlights on the ceiling)• Every one of these cases has to provide a path to the headphone jack that requires a slim plug - and all of them come with anadapter, you only need the adapter for cheap or high-end headphones that the mfgr refused to follow apple\\'s standards and make a slim plug that fits in cases, and the apple headphones and philips, sony and others work great with it. That said, though the ring for the headphone hole is totally flush with the bottom of the case, it does flare out away from the beveled edges, so you always can \\'feel\\' it sticking out, and that feels odd to be honest, but it\\'s a minor concern of an otherwise very well designed case.Now for The Good:• Update: Who cares about the bad: the case WORKS. I just spent 19 hours at Disneyland for their 24hr event, and the battery is still at 30% after draining the case’s battery at around 7 hours in. I have been using the case for several weeks and the best thing about it is that if I forget to plug my phone in at night (as I do sometimes) I’ll have the battery case to charge the phone up and it’ll last me 2+ days of heavy usage. This is amazing, I can’t even gush hard enough about how much this has enhanced owning an iPhone. No more fear about battery. NONE. It’s INSANE.• The case is beautiful, it\\'s one of the slimmest and well designed cases out there, the benchmark being of course Mophie, the ANKER gives mophie a run for their money. Look at the grilles for the microphone and speaker: the Anker grilles resemble the Apple ear-piece speaker grille, a long pill shape with a black metal mesh with microscopic holes; as opposed to a lot of the cheap ones with gargantuan ugly plastic holes or just a big channel for the sound to pass through, the case has a nice soft-touch finish that feels good in the hand.• The iPhone\\'s buttons are exposed with a shallow-recess and a nice slope into them - this is in contrast to overlayed buttons or crevices you have to dig your fingers into. With the case on I\\'m able to operate all buttons and the switch normally, and it has the added benefit of being able to set the phone landscape on a surface leaning against an object and being perfectly straight (as cases with raised buttons make it lopsided).• The case has a on-off button so that you can keep using the phone\\'s battery until you are ready to use the case\\'s battery. and it\\'s easy with just a single button tap of it\\'s power button on back. For those of us who like to gauge our usage this is important because some battery cases are \\'always on\\' until they die. This case keeps it\\'s charge until you need it, allowing you to take the phoen in and out of the case without it turning on automatically. However there is one small caveat: plugging the case into microUSB to charge it also turns it \\'on\\' (but you can turn it off).• It\\'s the easiest to get on and off the phone that I\\'ve seen, you grab the camera hole and lift, phone slides in very smooth and easy. This does give me concern however that the friction and snaps that hold the cap in place may wear out over time and it may fall off, but it\\'s not loose at all, and because it has little channels cut out for uses the silence-switch and camera protrusion as guides to find it\\'s home, it\\'s very unlikely it would ever fall off on it\\'s own.• It provides ample power to charge a phone to 100% quickly;• it\\'s camera hole on back is perfect with no issuesFinal Notes:• BUY this one. After shopping around and comparing to friends’ models from other brands, this one is THE BEST not only for the money, but for it’s quality. I’m definitely an ANKER fan now.

It has the soft grip shell that is reminiscent of the Nexus 5 material. Subtle lighting in the back, port openings for headphones and lightning cable and speakers. The wireless charging with the dock works very well and was plug and play basically. Love it!\\nFirst, I was not given this battery to review, I actually bought it.  I checked other extended batteries but I did not want to spend that much (Hyperion & Zerolemon) so I decided to try it out, glad I did! Battery came with 50% juice.  I didnt try to calibrate or anything the first time around, I just wanted to waste the battery.  I got to 1% and it lasted 1 hour 20 minutes at 1% until it died.  I went ahead and charged it and it took about 5 1/2 hours to fully charge.  At 5 hours it was at 100% but said still charging with the red light.  Waited 1/2 hour more and it finally said &#34;Charged&#34; and the green light went on.  I calibrated the battery once it was full and was ready to test it. I use my phone, and when I say use, I mean use.  I did put the brightness alittle above 50% (since i usually have it at 30%) and was able to get 1 day and 22 hours of use.  Wifi, GPS, Sync 3 emails, tons of texts, music and videos, and games. I listened to almost 12 hours of music on Google Play, 5 hours of music of my own, and 9 1/2 hours of screen time.  That to me is alot and that is under heavy use. I would not hesitate to recommend this battery, great company and great use.  The back cover is nice and has great grip, not like others.  I would get a cover (Hyperions $9.99 cover) to add some protection.  I have the Note 4 for T-Mobile and the case fit perfectly.  You do have to snap it hard. Overall, I am greatly impressed by this battery.  Buy without hesitation.\\nI did an amp test to see what my Moto X (1st gen) was pulling. For both ports it was ~1amp. And also my Nvidia Shield Tablet pulling ~1.8amps on both ports. A little confusing when one port is stated to be rated at 1amp but i\\'m getting 1.8. Works well though!\\nLots of people complaining about this charger.#1... you DO NOT have to remove your case in order to charge the phone. There\\'s an insert on the charge, that when removed, allows you to mount the phone on the charger WITHOUT removing your case. I have a pretty thick case and my phone fits fine and charges just fine with the case on after I snapped the insert out. (see photo below which shows phone charging and insert removed)#2... Don\\'t blame this charger for slow charging. This charger simply applies a charge to your battery. What the battery does with that charge is determined by the condition of the battery. My phone charges fine with a new battery. I have an old battery and it charges slow. That\\'s why I switched it out a long time ago. And the shipping was much faster than advertised. Good item at a great price.\\nThis is an amazing piece of tech, provides charge for any usb capable device with juice to spare! The solar panels are truly the icing on the cake. Took this thing camping and everyone I was with wants one now.\\nPerfect,  exact and fresh official batteries for my family\\'s set of 3 Galaxy S5\\'s. Great to know we have backup ready for when we need it. Even though original batteries are still charging fine after one year of daily use.NOTICE!!  Another reviewer said the small white strip on the end of battery would be plain if it ever got wet.  Turns out HE is all Wet!  All of our batteries and all the batteries inspected at 3 phone stores all had plain white strips on the end.  They will show red printing through the white part if they ever do get wet. Like that unfortunate reviewers battery showed. The contacts will also show use when brand new because they HAVE to TEST the battery before they approve it for sale.  Please see photo.\\nSometimes, it\\'s not what you\\'ve bought but how well it\\'s supported that separates the winners from the losers. The first battery I received did not hold a charge. Daeta responded to my inquiry promptly, diagnosed the issue (a bad chip controlling the battery) and sent another. Daeta kept me informed of the status of the replacement, and the whole interaction was pleasant, supportive, and helpful. The new battery works great (the product itself is as described, the instructions were very clear and very easy to follow, and it\\'s a cheap solution to making an older phone function like new again). And I\\'m very happy. HIGHLY recommend.\\nCharger worked great initailly, however about 1 month after the return period expired it stopped working now the led light is on constantly and it no longer charges my phone or recharge it self when its pluged in. 3/26/2015 - Aukey customer service responded to my post immediately and offered to send a replacement to correct the issue without me having to ask a new one. When I initially wrote the review I thought that I was stuck with a defective charger since the return window past. however I only had to wait 3 days to have a replacement in hand. I am very satisfied with this product as well so the company as a whole, and from now on I will only buy Aukey products.\\nIf you own a power-hungry smartphone, get one of these -- I learned the hard way why these portable battery chargers are well worth buying. For years, I avoided buying one, thinking that these were mainly items of convenience, and I would always have a power source of some sort somewhere nearby. This summer proved me wrong. Driving along the interstate, several long tree limbs blew off of the truck in front of me and pierced through the front of my car, shutting my engine down and forcing me to coast to the side of the road. I picked up my phone to call AAA, and --- there was only 6% battery left. There was just enough charge to finish calling a tow truck, and then it died. I was on the side of a major city\\'s interstate, with no safe way to get to a shop with a phone, and my car couldn\\'t charge my phone..... %*#$!@#$(*. Since that, I always had at least one battery charger in my purse at all time, and this is by far the best of the several different models I own.  Quick summary of why this one rocks above the others: - Recharges cell phones 2.5 times when using the 1A slot (granted, I\\'ve only tested it on two different phones, but I doubt that would vary significantly) - Offers two different current options for recharging your device: 1A current (slower recharge, but more efficient so more juice per single charge of the powerbank), or 2.1A current (recharges a device quickly, but drains the powerbank. Using the 2.1A slot, you\\'d probably get close to 1.75 to 2 cell phone charges instead of 2.5). - Allows for tablet recharging for the same reason as above (has a 2.1A option) - The powerbank itself recharges quickly - Solid, quality construction - The flashlight is a wonderful extra - The price is the same as other, similar products that are of inferior construction and don\\'t hold nearly as much charge  I\\'m not the best at writing reviews, but if you\\'re on the fence, this is the one to get.  ------  Edit April 2016: Still going strong. Turns out it\\'s also great to haveone of these while camping, going to concerts, etc. I just connect my phone and let it charge while sitting in my purse/backpack.\\nFirst, regarding this power bank - it\\'s awesome! I\\'ve been using it for a couple of months. After trying an Anker product that quit recharging after a few weeks, I decided to give Mogix a try based on positive reviews. What a great decision that turned out to be! My Mogix charges my Samsung Galaxy S3 3-4 times before needing a recharge itself. It\\'s about the same size as my phone, so it\\'s small and light enough to carry in my hand or purse. Its sleek curves elicit a &#34;that\\'s cool&#34; response from those who see it! It also charges my Kindle Fire and Ipod Touch. I take my Mogix with me everywhere.Now a word about the Mogix company. Their customer support is over-the-top fantastic! I appreciate their emails checking on how the product is working for me. Note - you can opt out of these if you prefer. They offer helpful suggestions on how to improve battery life on devices as well as how to best use the Mogix external battery. I had a rogue app burning through the battery on my phone. Before discovering the bad app, I blamed the problem on the Mogix battery and contacted the company. They were willing to replace the power bank for free! You can\\'t get better customer service than that!I highly recommend the Mogix external battery and the company for its excellent customer service!!\\nLove me some solar power!I have to admit, I am somewhat skeptical of the claimed efficiency of better than 21%, making it one of the highest efficiency solar panels available in the mass market at this time. It is possible that it is true, but considering the converter that is taking the electricity from the cells and making USB standard power *has to* have some loss associated with it, it seems unlikely.Being a tech minded guy, I test stuff. Its what I do.As everyone will tell you, if using a solar charger, it is better to use a battery pack to store the power when the sun is shining and charge your devices from the battery pack. This solar charger is not a battery pack, it simply takes sunshine and creates 5V output through standard USB ports.**Update** 4/25/15Bright sunny day today, measures around 165,000 lux (using my Galaxy S5 and &#34;GPS Status&#34; app on phone) just past solar noon in southern new england.Today I used 2 Drok USB power meters, one in each output port and two devices (phone and battery pack) to pull maximum power from the panel.I was pleasantly surprised to see a total charge power of 1.9 Amps!! (divided between my battery pack and phone)This is a significant increase in power \\'generation\\' from the last test, and is almost as powerful as the fastest USB wall chargers available today, so to me, this is huge! It still falls about 50% short of the 20W claim but as previously noted, solar panels never hit their claimed  power production numbers due to a standard which is laboratory based and effectively impossible to achieve in the real world. Additionally, there are conversion losses to be accounted for with this product.All in all, the X-Dragon High Efficiency 20W Solar Panel is a pretty awesome way to have real, usable USB power anywhere the sun shines.Highly recommended!** UPDATE ** 3/16/2015Bright sunny sky today, measures at around 110,000 lux, but still, ides of March sun @ ~41°N LatitudeInitially I hooked up two high drain devices to see what the maximum output would be but it never got higher than it did with one high drain device, specifically, my Ravpower battery pack for portable charging of any usb powered device.I saw a peak power output of 1.37A @ 4.91V for a total of 6.72Watts output power. On one hand this is disappointing considering the stated 20Watt ability of the solar charger, BUT considering that spec is STC (standard testing conditions) no solar panel ever produces the stated STC spec in the real world.Using my phone as a point of reference, the battery in my phone is 10.8Watt hour capacity, charging at the measured value of 6.72watts *Should* take about an 1:40 (one hour forty minutes) to charge fully from dead.. Which is about what it takes when plugged into an AC powered adapter.. so I am completely satisfied with the purchase at this time.Conclusion, it does the job it is supposed to do, creates free power from the sun to charge your USB powered devicesOriginal test 3/15/2015**TO BE FAIR, conditions are not ideal for testing today, being PRETTY OVERCAST at the moment and ~41°N latitude.Using an app on my phone (Galaxy S5) , I measured the currently available light at around 11,000 lux.I set up the panel angled somewhat to the south, after a couple seconds the LED lit up on the power outlet so I plugged in my Portapow USB power meter in line, and plugged in my Ravpower battery pack as a load to take the charge power.The meter indicated 4.93V  @ 0.34A which means it would probably charge your phone, but fairly slowly.Most plug in USB wall chargers produce between 1 and 2.4A at 5v so by comparison this is a fairly slow charge.The battery on my phone is 2800mAh so at a .33A charge rate it would take 8.2 hours at current conditions to fully charge the battery from dead.. if the phone was off.Bottom line, in overcastconditions the power production is fairly pitiful, but that was somewhat expected.This review may be updated again when/if I am able to test the unit under even better conditions.nditions the power production is fairly pitiful, but that was somewhat expected.This review may be updated again when/if I am able to test the unit under even better conditions.\\nCompared to other external battery packs that I own, this unit from RAVPower has exceeded my expectations with price, form, and function.This unit included:1. RAVPower RP-PB19(B) external power bank2. 2 USB to Mini USB cables (one 2ft and one 1ft)3. 2 Connectors (30 pin iPhone and micro usb)4. 1 User Guide5. 1 Travel pouch (This was a great addition)The specs of this device are as follows:- 5 x 0.9 x 3.2 inches- 11.4 ounces- Input: DC 5V/1.5A (Standard Micro USB Port)- USB A1:5V/2.4A max , USB A2:5V/2.1A max- iSmart technology enabling charge speeds of up to 4 amps.- 15000mAh capacity- 4 status LEDs for capacity remaining- Built-in flashlight- Automatic shutdown for short circuit or overload- One year warrantyThe pros of this unit are:The unit is well built and of solid construction. You can charge two devices at once. You can also charge this unit while charging two of your devices at the same time (the unit will get a little warm to the touch, nothing crazy). Doing this will drain the battery faster than it can charge though. iSmart technology will turn the unit on when it senses your device to rapidly charge your devices and power off when your devices are fully charged. The 15000 mAh capacity greatly reduces the amount of times you have to charge this device and will provide multiple charges to your devices before needing a recharge. The included usb cables are tangle free (flat) and well constructed. There is also a drawstring mesh travel pouch included with this unit that is a nice addition and will fit the power bank, usb cables, and connectors nicely. I tend to use one of the little ziplock bags to conveniently store all the cables and connectors with the unit in the travel pouch.The built-in flashlight is bright and can be turned off and on with a long press of the single button. You can check the battery capacity left with a quick press of the button (4 LEDs = 75-100% 3 LEDs =50-75% 2 LEDs= 25-50% 1 LED= &#60;25%). The user guide is very clear and well written.When I received this unit I fully charged it. I the preceded to charged my phone from 5% to 100% (1810mAh) two times, two Gopro Hero 3+ Black (from one battery bar on the Gopro display 1050mAh each), and one Gopro Hero 4 Black (from one battery bar on the GoPro display1180mAh) off of a single charge of the unit with battery life to spare. This unit is also great for doing extended time lapses with the Gopro cameras.The cons of this unit are: (I didn\\'t have any cons with this unit, but for some these maybe cons)This unit does have a little size and weight to it. This unit will fit into the front and back pocket of my jeans. The unit did seem a bit bulky in my front pocket though. Also, I must add that this unit will take a while to charge. It can take up to 7 hours to charge with a 5v/1.5A wall adapter (not included).As you can see the pros far out weight the cons for me with this unit.

So I looked on Amazon and found this case is works great now I dont have to bring my charging cord and plug everywhere and also I drop my phone sometimes and this case holds it up really nice...\\nThis has to be one of my favorite purchases of all time.  The OEM battery on the original LG G3 is very poor.  To give you guys an example I will give you a detailed explanation on my day and how the battery would work.  I left the house at around 7am with a full charge... I check texts here and there, make some calls, use it heavily on a 15 minute break and a 1 hour lunch... by 1pm the phone was near dying and I had to plug it up to a charge to make it home with charge.This extended battery?  WOAH.  Not only does it make the phone easier to grip like another reviewer said but I like the feel on the battery cover.  Someone said it was smooth or something but no .... it has a nice feel to it I cant describe it but it feels premium and is certainly not smooth.  I have been using it for a couple days and most recently as follows:5am disconnected with a full charge.  On purpose I used the phone heavily throughout the day.  Texting, calls, browsing the web, downloading applications, reading news on twitter, I streamed 2 three hour movies.... I mean the works.  By 6pm I had 18% battery left and under the battery settings it said I still had 2 hours left.  With the addition of this PowerBear LG G3 Extended battery this is the first time any phone I have ever had has lasted me this long into the day without needing a charge.  This is all with heavy usage imagine with moderate usage?  WOAH.  Another thing I noticed is that unlike the original LG G3 battery, when this battery gets near the 30 to 20% range you notice the extra juice.  It seems like it stays there forever before it starts Battery saver mode (I have it set to start at 15%)... this is just a great product and for the price anyone that has an LG G3 needs to get it.Update:  Its been several several weeks now with this extended battery and I must say it is arguably my smartest purchase on Amazon.  The battery lasts me until the night with heavy heavy use.  With light use?  With a full charge in the morning it has lasted me until the next day.  I charge the phone now only over night and one full charge is good to get me through a day comfortably.  This is a must buy for LG G3 owners.  I no longer worry about battery life or looking for a charger.  Also,  the more battery conscious you are the better.  I use my phone on auto brightness to get the most juice out of my battery.  That is pretty much the only setting I manipulate.  The brightness.  If you manipulate other settings to maximize your battery life then you might get even more than me.has lasted me until the next day.

Took a chance, this thing works great- so much so, I never write reviews but feel compelled to bc this bad boy keeps my phone charged all day from 4:30am to 7;30pm with juice to spare. I literally work on my phone all day. I\\'ve dropped it, had for weeks and put it thru it\\'s paces and feel very confident in recommending.\\nMy wife, my son and I each have Galaxy S4 phones which are approaching two years old. When we got them, they were blindingly fast and would run, in fairly heavy use, for two days before requiring a recharge. Over time, though, I noticed mine seemed to be slowing down and required more frequent charging, often giving me a low-battery alarm in far less than a day. My wife and son noticed the same with theirs. I purchased external charging batteries, which helped, and uninstalled apps we didn\\'t absolutely need, which had almost no effect either on speed or battery life.  As a last resort before replacing the phones, I ordered three RAVPower 2600mah replacement batteries, chiefly because so many of the &#34;genuine Samsung&#34; replacement batteries were being identified as counterfeits.  The first day we saw no improvement, but the instructions advised that several charge-discharge cycles were needed to obtain the full capacity of the batteries, and that is exactly what we noticed. By the third day we were already getting full-day performance, and after a week our phones were once again working for two full days before a recharge was needed. We were also pleased to find that the phones seemed to have recovered their original speed and responsiveness; I suspect the original batteries were unable to provide the current needed for all phone functions. (We\\'ve also noticed our phones now get good voice and data connections in areas which previously were unreliable or unusable, but this may relate more to major system upgrades our carrier has made in the area than to the new batteries.)  I wholeheartedly recommend the RAVPower batteries, especially if you are considering replacing your expensive phone for the sort of performance issues we were experiencing.\\nSo I Just Got My New Charger Case & I Absolutely Love It . Its So Cute . I Deffinally Think You Should Get This . Its A Very Great Product And It Matches My Yellow iPhone . 💕👏\\nI have purchased three Samsung OEM batteries for the Galaxy Avant from Amazon vendor Seller1on1.  The first battery arrived with a 58% charge, indicating that the battery was fresh and it had been properly stored.  The second battery arrived with zero charge, which could shorten its lifespan. Seller 1on1 kindly offered to replace that battery.  The third battery arrived with a 52% charge, which is in the ideal range of 45% to 55% charge for a new phone battery upon delivery.Seller1On1 is an Amazon vendor that can be trusted for your battery needs.  Most batteries sold on Amazon have five or six different vendors listed.  Look for vendors who have a 95%+ customer satisfaction rating, proof that they are selling fresh batteries, and that they will quickly replace a defective battery.To get the maximum life from a new phone battery, charge it to 100% (at least 4 hours of charging with the phone OFF) and then use the battery until it reaches zero and your phone shuts off.  Then charge it  again to 100%. That process calibrates your phone\\'s charging gauge to charge your battery to its fullest capacity.  Repeat that calibration process every two or three months.Except for calibrating the battery gauge, it is best to charge your battery when it reaches about 30% rather than run it down to zero.  There is no need to charge your battery all the way up to 100%. Charging it just to 80% or 90% is fine.  A battery\\'s lifespan is greatly extended if it is kept in the 30% to 80% charge range most of the time.When you store a phone battery, store it with a 45% to 55% charge in a cool and dry location.  Storing a battery with a 100% charge will age a battery quickly.  Storing a battery with a ZERO charge can prevent the battery from holding a charge.\\nI bought this for a thru-hike on the Colorado Trail. I am a bit of a gram geek, but this thing will give you at least 10 days worth of full from zero charges on an iPhone 5. I am in the process of killing my phone and charging it back from 0 so that I can leave feedback on the amount of times it will charge from 0. I will update in a couple of weeks once the Anker Astro E7 External battery dies. I use my iphone 5 for my GPS, music, maps, cell phone, guide book and camera as well, so I can justify the added weight of the external battery.I have recorded the weights here:The unit itself (Anker Astro E7 External battery) weighs in at 481g or 17 oz (1lb,1 oz)The Anker charger is 46g or 1.625 oz.The anker charging cable is 17g or .625 ozThe apple 1m &#34;lighting&#34; charging cable is 17g or .625 ozThe black bag that comes with the charger is 12g or .375 ozI am going to use a ziplock quart bag (6g)Total weight for the charging package is 568g or 1lb 4 oz or 20 oz.The Anker charger will work charging the iPhone 5, so you can eliminate the apple charger from your pack.The external battery has a small LED on it that can be used for light in an emergency. I would not eliminate my headlamp, though. There are 3 USB slots on the charger, so you can charge a friends phone too if you are feeling generous with your amps. All in all, so far--I would suggest this charger if you are going to be on the trail-outside of towns for an extended length of time. I have had 10-14 days between overnight hostel stays, so I believe this will be a great addition to the pack. It will take a good 12-16 hours to recharge the battery pack using the dedicated 10w charger. I would suggest purchasing the wall charger and not relying on one that you have laying around the house. The casing is slippery and will smudge up pretty easy, but if you are hiking 15 mile days and haven\\'t showered in a week, smudges aren\\'t at the top of the concern pyramid. I have included a couple of pictures that show the blue charge lights, the LED as well as the size of the battery.Update: I got 9.69 full charges for the iPhone 5 out of one full charge of the Anker Astro E7 external battery.  I say .69 because my daughters iphone 5 was on 31% when she plugged it in one night. I plugged it in at 6:30am this morning and as of 7PM this evening the battery is flashing the 75-100% range, so what this says to me. I hike for 9 days and then choose to stay the night at a hostel or in a hotel, take a zero day, I can charge the battery and hike for another 9 days and continue running my battery down to 0. Realistically, if you put your phone on airplane mode, you wont run it down to zero in 1 day. Probably not even 3 days. But that is another story. Yes, I would suggest this battery.f the concern pyramid.

I like that it only holds a little more than one full battery charge because I get in the habit of charging it right after I use it. Highly recommend!!!\\nInitially, I was bummed to have to turn my thin, lightweight phone into something that resembled a brick.  This case is so manly, it jumped off my hip and started breaking iPhone 6ses to prove dominance.  Then I took it on a business trip and realized I had forgotten a charger.  Was very ticked when the first day the battery ran down to 20%; I had seen reviews of this battery lasting for days.  But then it proceeded to last at 1% for four full days, plus my flight home, and it still wasn\\'t dead, despite the phone telling me it was going to die any minute.  It took another day and a half for it to finally die.That alone was worth the price of admission.  Now let me tell you about the Zeroshock case.  I feel this is a better case than the Otterbox; it definitely can take a beating.  My phone jumped off my hip and secretly landed under my car.  As I was backing up, my wheel rolled on top of the phone.  Wondering what was going on, I pulled forward to see what I ran over.  My heart sank when I saw it was my phone...until I realized the case barely had a scratch on it.  A microfiber wipe of the screen and you\\'d never know it happened.Buy this thing already.  You\\'l be glad you did.\\nI am hard to please. I have been called a &#34;curmudgeon.&#34; This RAVPower thing is the best thing ever. I don\\'t even plug my phone into the wall anymore to charge it. I only use the external battery. My iphone is a little damaged and has trouble charging. Sometimes, I plug it into the wall charger and it says it\\'s charging and stops the second i look away. The external battery seems to be the only thing that will charge it consistently from start to finish.  It charges my iphone from completely dead to 100% in about half an hour.I can go days without having to recharge the external battery. When you do have to recharge it, it does take forever.  But if you charge it overnight it takes a few hours and then automatically stops charging when it\\'s full.The two ports are perfect for charging a tablet at the same time. Obviously, it is bulky and doesn\\'t really fit well in your pocket, but I am ok with that because it charges so fast and goes so long before it has to be charged itself.  Overall, I\\'d give it a 93/100\\n*I got this phone about 16 hours ago, so this may change.The phone is exactly what I feel is being advertised, a really solid mid-range Android phone with huge battery life.Pros (so far):Battery life (I got the phone with 75% battery and I haven\\'t charged it yet and I\\'m sitting at around 40% after a bunch of use including setup/downloading all my apps)Feels nice for a $149 phoneLots of accessories includedCons (so far):Slippery edge, could lead to dropsIf you use Lux (or an app like it), the screen does not take well to color manipulation. By turning down the temp of the colors, it totally over saturates yellows.Over notes:Blu has some cool features like a custom tool box on the notification screen and system manager that breaks down charge time and power consumption in more detail than stock android.The phone seemed a little jittery when navigating around compared to the Nexus 5 I\\'m coming from (of course it did, right!?) but I put the Google launcher on and switched to the google keyboard and it seems super smooth now.\\nI love that Samsung still makes flagship phones with a removable battery. This is a great feature that most people don\\'t realize at first. When you have a phone with a sealed battery like an iPhone, Galaxy S6 or a Nexus, you\\'ve purchased a device with planned obsolescence i.e. (designing a product with an artificially limited useful life, so it will become obsolete). After a year of use (or even sooner depending on charging cycles) the battery will slowly begin losing its ability to hold a charge and you are eventually faced with an invasive repair to replace the battery or purchase a new device. With a device like the Note 1,2,3 or 4 you can simply peel the back cover off and swap out another battery in under 30 seconds.With iPhones, Nexus and other sealed battery devices you have 3 options once you notice the battery starting to degrade:1. Buy a new phone (Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers prefer you do this)2. Send it in to a repair shop to replace the battery ($100 average minimum charge + shipping for the service which could take 1 to 2 weeks before you get your phone back)3. Do It Yourself (DIY) route. Spend hours watching YouTube videos on how to swap out the battery. But before that you have to order the proper tools to open the phone without damaging it, make sure there aren\\'t any adhesives holding the device together otherwise you\\'ll need a heat gun. Oh, I forgot to mention that you\\'ve just voided any remaining warranty...I travel to Asia often and it\\'s great knowing I have 3 fully charged batteries in my carry on ready to be swapped out at a moments notice. I don\\'t have to carry a juice pack or some giant case with an extended battery in order to keep my phone charged.As a person who keeps phones 2 to 3 years or longer, I appreciate the fact that Samsung doesn\\'t deliberately seal their devices in order to discourage owners from replacing batteries. Batteries are pretty much the only component of a mobile device that wear out over time so we should be able to easily and quickly replace that component when the time comes.Update: I was surprised the S6 came out with a sealed battery, I am even more worried that the Note 5 will also have this similar design where the battery will be sealed and the MicroSD slot will be removed. Samsung reps if you are out there I want you to take this into consideration. If I wanted an iphone I would have purchased an iphone. Your key differentiators of removable batteries and microSD are what kept me coming back to your devices. If you remove these two key features (and yes I consider them features) then you no longer have anything enticing to lure the power users over. Hopefully LG doesn\\'t go full apple and start sealing all their devices up as well. I find it funny to read all the tech blogger sites complain about how devices don\\'t feel premium, then when the manufacturers build them out of glass and adamantium they note how microsd and removable batteries &quot;had&quot; to go. I don\\'t agree with this at all. Look at how premium the Note 4 looks and it still manages to include a removable battery and microsd. As for the expandable storage MicroSD, I don\\'t know about the rest of you but my MicroSD holds all my photos, movies and music. I can\\'t put everything on the cloud because I don\\'t have unlimited data and wireless signals don\\'t work in some location like, subway, airplane, saturated areas. So if I kept all my media in the cloud I would be out of luck. That\\'s why I like all my media to reside on my MicroSD as it\\'s always available and easy to take in and out. I\\'m going to end this rant.Thanks for reading and consider tweeting @SamsungMobile to let them know they are making a huge mistake by removing removable batteries and MicroSD from their devices.  &quot;We Demand to be Taken Seriously&quot;\\nDidn\\'t seem to have any longer life than the year+ battery I bought it to replace. I bought two batteries; same results with both. The batteries certainly work, but the phone still dies before the day is through. I do use the phone heavily for social media, email, and web browsing, but the original battery used to allow me to go a couple days before I had to recharge. This one I get maybe 2-3 hours of use before it dies. Not sure if this is the battery\\'s fault or something on my phone sucking up too much power. Going to spring for a battery directly from Samsung (at almost 5x the cost) to see if it makes a difference, or if it\\'s an issue with my phone or how I\\'m using it. Will update this review with the results.UPDATED - I removed an app I\\'d recently installed (one that was supposed to reduce the blue light emissions from the display) and now the battery lasts a lot longer. Still not as good as the original battery when it was new, but it now lasts on average about 12-14 hours, so I can usually get through the day without recharging. Upgraded the stars from 3 to 4. Not bad, considering how much cheaper it is than one directly from Samsung. Samsung\\'s got the batteries on back order, but I think I may still order one when they come in just to see if it\\'s worth the price difference.UPDATED - Received batteries from Samsung, and the battery life of those and these is comparable, so upgrading these to 5 stars, since they were much cheaper than the Samsung batteries. Decided to turn off Wi-Fi most of the time unless I\\'m doing something data-intensive, and that seems to have extended the battery life a great deal. (I\\'d already turned off GPS except when using it.) I could now probably go at least a day between charges if I\\'m not using the phone heavily.\\nUPDATE : So, I\\'ve been having this product for a couple months. I actually have (3) just because I\\'m in the military. I work long hours in the field in the middle of no where at times. This by far is the best battery power bank I have ever owned. I can\\'t stress it enough. I\\'m not a fan of the Metallic finish on it but it stays in it\\'s pouch so who cares. Great device to have and I totally recommend! FIVE STARS!\\nThe package was supposed to come January 27 and I got it January 5th. The shipping process was so fast and I have a iPhone 5c and it fits perfectly . It\\'s a little thick dont get me wrong but it\\'s worth it when ur phone is about to die. Lol I highly reccomend this\\nDrop in and fits like the OEM battery. Charge last longer than original battery for the S3. Highly recommended.\\nI bought this for my wife who frequently gets her smartphone battery flat and becomes unreachable. As of January 2015, this is the highest capacity portable charger equipment on the market and looked to me as the ultimate solution for our problem. All she needs to do is to carry it in her bag at all times. After using it for around a month here are our hands on experience:Pros:-It came fully charged which might be a real handy thing for someone who needs it right out of the box.-The instructions are easy to follow and are offered in two languages (English and German).-The switch which allows you to check the remaining level only shows the level for 5 seconds using the four tiny lights each indicating a 25% of remaining capacity. So It does not light up all the time, only as long as you need.-It comes with two charging cords already. However those were not 20 and 60 cm as advertised. They were both 20cm (7.87 inches) long for which I can not complain since I don\\'t want long cables hanging around in the bag and close proximity is no big deal for me.-It can charge two devices at the same time and two ports have different charging abilities for different needs. The 2.1A port is what you should be connecting your tablets and the 1A port is mostly for the smartphones. You can also connect the smartphone to 2.1A and it won\\'t change much but plugging a tablet to 1A port may mean slower charging for that device.-It looks solid and stylish. It holds the stored power level even after a two weeks of no use.Cons:-That stuff is real heavy. I think it is no less than a pound  and that makes it not  much of a pocket thing. For ladies side bags where they dump everything, this can still be okay as a permanent thing but if you want something a lot light weight you should go for the lipstick type chargers but they would require being recharged after even one single use, whereas this monster can go for a much longer time.-No adapter included.: This may not be a big issue since it can be charged with the same adapter that most smartphones and tablets get charged (all you need is a Micro B USB end) yet for the price tag of $34.99 (as of december 2014) it would be handy to have one.What I can not comment on for now is:-Durability (how it handles the impacts of daily use) and longevity (howlong it lasts before requiring more frequent charging and decreasing its capacity etc.)In summary, I have so far liked it and keep updating this review if I find out something to note..this monster can go for a much longer time.-No adapter included.: This may not be a big issue since it can be charged with the same adapter that most smartphones and tablets get charged (all you need is a Micro B USB end) yet for the price tag of $34.99 (as of december 2014) it would be handy to have one.What I can not comment on for now is:-Durability (how it handles the impacts of daily use) and longevity (howlong it lasts before requiring more frequent charging and decreasing its capacity etc.)In summary, I have so far liked it and keep updating this review if I find out something to note..\\nI obsessively searched for a battery case. I have an iPhone5s. For some reason, after multiple iOS upgrades, my phone\\'s battery life became unbearably short. After reading about Mophie\\'s problems with knockoffs and bootlegs, I steered away from them. After reading reviews of the Stalion Stamina, I decided to take a chance and purchase the Stamina 2400mAh Rechargeable Extended. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made. If you have a 5s and your battery life is poor, please give this product a chance. It is reasonable priced and very good quality. Thanks to all the people at Stalion for manufacturing such a good product.\\nI love it and I didnt know this till I got it but it lights up\\nI took a little long to come, but besides that it was amazing! It protects my phone and the charging really works. Get it!\\nI am a long-time cell phone user/owner and I have replaced many batteries. I\\'ve replaced the OEM batteries with physically bigger (where you had to replace the rear cover and higher amp-hour aftermarket batteries. In 98.5% of the replacements, the aftermarket battery was inferior to the OEM battery.  In the other 1.5% of the cases, the aftermarket battery was physically bigger and simply had more amp-hour capacity. I was intrigued by the Ravpower\\'s warranty and great reviews so I gave it a try.  I use my S4 for e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g (especially NPR podcasts and Audible books) and my Samsung OEM battery was typically lasting around 12 hours. I received the Ravpower battery and fully charged it in the phone with the phone turned off.  I believe that the phone was on the charger perhaps an hour after the battery was fully charged.  I powered the S4 on and used it as usual.  I was quite surprised when 29 hours later the S4 showed the remaining battery capacity at 20%. That is outstanding!  If the Ravpower can maintain that type of battery life for several months, I will be a lifelong customer.  I\\'ve experienced no overheating and the phone actually seems more responsive.  As a side note, I power off my phone to charge the battery and I recharge it at 20% capacity.\\nI installed this battery case, and now when Skynet becomes self aware, it will launch from this device for unlimited power. Forget about blacking out the sun, the machines will just run the Matrix on this battery case. My phone literally refuses to die now. The instructions say to allow the battery to drain completely for the first 5-6 cycles, but that\\'s actually the hardest part - takes over 4 days to die, even with me doing everything I want to on the phone.The first charge cycle, I didn\\'t know what to expect and honestly wasn\\'t impressed at first because my battery seemed to drain pretty quickly - I was at 30% much faster than I expected. What I didn\\'t expect is that the phone will last for several days at 30%, probably because the battery meter on the phone is still calibrated to stock. It got down to 5% after 3 days, and I figured &#34;cool, time to charge&#34;. But then I remembered I\\'m supposed to let it die, so I installed a battery draining app hoping to kill it off quickly. This is a mistake, because the phone will last for an entire day even at 1%. Understand me: I *tried* to kill my phone. Benchmarking software, 3D gaming, maximum brightness, every radio on and cooking, vibration, flashlight... for HOURS... at &#34;critical battery&#34; levels. I found myself screaming obscenities at my phone to kick off already so I could plug it in.  As it stands, I can do everything my heart desires on my phone and the battery will still last for four days and change. It\\'s been almost three weeks and I\\'ve charged it three times, total. Draining this battery 6 times is actually going to be a month and a half challenge.Tips:1) Buy this battery case. You won\\'t regret it.2) When you get it, there are no instructions. Do not peel the white stickers off of the battery. This is unclear because it looks like packaging, with requests from the company to rate the product 5 stars written all over it.3) The case feels like one piece, but is really 2 pieces. Undo the flap at the bottom and pull back and you can see the separation in order to pull out the hard plastic cage. You need to peel back the soft outer shell from the hard inner cage to install the phone, but it\\'s not clear from the instructions.4) Leave it plugged in and charging for a full 12 hours. You can expect this charge to last you 4 days or so.5) Don\\'t panic and plug in your phone when it looks like low battery. Like I said, even on critical battery alerts the phone will run for a day or more.6) The size you will have to get used to, but honestly it\\'s not all that big. I personally like it, it feels solid and the buttons are much easier to press. It\\'s so thick you can stand it up on its side - literally its own stand. I consider this case to be the way the note 4 would have shipped out, had it been engineered in the 90\\'s or one of the early Nokia beasts.7) I haven\\'t dropped the phone, but this case honestly doesn\\'t seem like it would mind. Hold it in your hand and you\\'ll see what I meanlly 2 pieces. Undo the flap at the bottom and pull back and you can see the separation in order to pull out the hard plastic cage.

Hold it in your hand and you\\'ll see what I mean\\nYes it Fits 5c!\\nMy water-damaged OEM battery lasts longer - I bought this to replace it. I followed the 4-5 charging cycles at beginning and now the battery goes down to 95% in the first couple of minutes after unplugged from fully charged state. Barely lasts a day with WIFI OFF on the phone. Other than this, it looks nice, and fits the phone correctly (although brand label is upside-down when you insert it into the phone battery slot).    *UPDATE* 01/02/15  Sunvalleytek folks took great care of me when I had a problem. The first battery I purchased had some charging/draining issues, so they contacted ME after hearing about it through the product Feedback I had earlier posted. I received a replacement today in the mail, and it works great! This Seller really came through with their promises to help resolve the issue. OUTSTANDING SERVICE. WOW!! There were multiple people keeping in touch with me during the entire process as well. The new battery is definitely holding a good charge.\\nGreat little solar panel.  Definitely would recommend this panel to a friend!  I own this and the goal zero 20w panel, and although I can not use this panel to charge my goal zero solar generator, it does a great job for my portable, like my Jackey batteries. The price point is much more reasonable that others and it charges just as well as the more expensive NOMAD 20 SOLAR PANEL (199.99).  I own both and use the nomad with the Generator and use this great panel for my devices/battries.  The quality is almost identical to the Goal Zero, and maybe even a tad bit better.  You get way more bang for your buck with this lil baby.  :D\\nSo... i fully charge my nexus 5 3 times and 1 time an iphone 5s (let\\'s say 8k mah in rough numbers) with the first charge of this baby and it still had juice before i decided to charge it. Have to say it looks nice, the carry bag is nice too and is not so big/heavy considering the 16k mah that claims to have. The LED is just that, 1 LED, you don\\'t need more than that. The power button and the charge ports are all well located, where you expected to be, real easy not rocket science here.Is very useful if you punish your devices all day long, you wont regret it. Besides, anything more than this size is not so handy (imo). I\\'m still testing the charging times and how much juice i get, i\\'ll review this later.However the only issue that i see is that the supplied usb/microusb cable seems to take notoriously more time than using my nexus5 cable. I\\'ll try different cables to make a fully reviewThere are tons of external batteries out there but for now, i am really satisfied with this one.\\nA full charge from this literally can charge my dead phone twice or more. Really good product. Love how the physical appearance is made as well. Very nice to touch.\\nI own this case in both \\'varieties \\', the wireless as well as the non-wireless charging covers.  Both are well made and stand up to a lot of abuse in my opinion.  Granted, they don\\'t offer the same protection as an otter box but I have dropped my Note 4 in the non-wireless case from 3 feet onto a hard-wood floor with no damage (the phone landed on a corner).  The case is very attractive in the charcoal color that I have.What I particularly like about this case and one big reason I prefer it over previous Verizon cases, is not just the functionality offered by the quick access to apps when the cover is closed, but the simple fact that it doesn\\'t turn my phone on automatically every time I remove or place it in my pocket.  Before, when I would use the Verizon case (with kick-stand) with my other Galaxy\\'s (S3, S4, S5),  I would always inadvertently hit the home button when sliding it in my pants pockets - turning on the phone, making calls, opening apps.  And the way around that was to use the lock screen which I don\\'t really like to do.  But with this cover, I just close it and slide it (in my pocket).  I don\\'t know....it just works for me.The reason I have both covers is because I travel a lot and don\\'t want to carry anything more than I have to, meaning the wireless charging device.  So when traveling I carry a spare battery with the Samsung charging case.  And I\\'ll switch that battery once a day as I am a heavy user.  And it\\'s very easy to switch in this case.  And the case does not degrade with that much opening and closing.I use the wireless casing when I\\'m not traveling (when I\\'m at home-base).  And for that I use a couple of Samsung wireless charging pads.  (The white pads by Samsung advertised for the Galaxy S4.  Not the mini black pad).  You just place it on the pad and it starts charging.  I didn\\'t like the mini-pad because you had to be a little more concerned with how you placed the phone.  But the larger white pad fits the Note perfectly and I just lay the phone down square and I\\'m done.I hope my review was helpful to anyone interested in this case.  If it was, please check in the comments below.  Thank you.just lay the phone down square and I\\'m done.    I hope my review was helpful to anyone interested in this case.  If it was, please check in the comments below.  Thank you.\\nFirst of all I\\'ll preface this with the fact that I don\\'t often write reviews.  It\\'s not my style, I leave that to other people.Now with that out of the way let me say that like most people who run a &#34;smart&#34; device life, I found myself needing more juice on a daily basis. I had researched plenty of battery packs in an attempt to get the most out of my hard earned cash.When I came across this particular battery pack I picked it up after researching and reading all the previous reviews.  My experience with it initially wasn\\'t very satisfying.  I charged it as per instructions yet when I went to use it, I found that it barely charged my iPhone 6+ to 40% before completely dying.I was going to just send it back to Amazon for a refund but instead I decided to contact the manufacturer by replying to their email regarding my purchase. I emailed them at 8pm and when I woke the next day I saw that they had emailed me around 4:30am.Long story short they helped me trouble shoot the issue I was having. They asked how I had charged it and said that the charger should be at least a 1.5A charger. I was using my iPhone charger (white cube). I tried again with a 2A charger and it\\'s worked amazingly since then.I\\'m extremely satisfied with the battery pack and highly recommend it.Also the fact that their customer service was so quick and accommodating was very refreshing.Don\\'t hesitate to pick it up.  I already have 3 friends who are going to pick one up.\\nTrue plug and play selfie stick.  Worked perfectly out of the box with my iPhone 5s.  Got it right before our trip to Vegas with 10 other couples.  We used it to capture the group during dinners and walking the strip.  Others in our group had more expensive selfie sticks that required Bluetooth connection.  Ours became the go-to since it was easiest to use and most reliable.  You just plug it in, push the photo icon, and start snapping away.  Never once had a problem with the capture button.  I was worried about the phone possibly slipping out while fully extended, but it never once budged.\\nHave only used it once and that was a test run. Worked fine.It would be nice if somehow the power cord could be made integral to the device to keep it from getting lost or misplaced.\\nI was somewhat leery of placing this order because there seem to be a lot of fake-looking reviews of this product (note to manufacturer -- just so you know, that cluster of weird one-review 5-star reviews almost made me not order). However I\\'m glad I took the plunge. It can charge my Windows tablet rapidly, at 5000 mAh with the supplied cable (I think it\\'s just a bit less than the power outlet/original charger), which is more than enough to keep the battery percentage going nicely up even while running games etc. I tried it with my longer cables and the charging rate dropped a lot, so keep that in mind if you\\'re not getting a fast rate. Touch bar is okay, I don\\'t care about it much, kind of gimmicky but looks cool. Product feels premium and the felt case and packaging are quality. My tech colleagues were all impressed. We are major gadget geeks, so if we\\'re interested in a thing that\\'s usually a good sign. It is very light and the form factor is smooth and unobtrusive. I picked this one for the shape, as a lot of other external battery packs have annoying corners or are bulky squarish tubes. This is almost unnoticeable and I\\'m pretty fussy about carrying extra weight and bulk around with me. Doesn\\'t seem to get hot either, after a couple weeks of light use.The L-cable that it comes with feels very sturdy and the microUSB connector clicks in solidly without wobbling. I\\'ve been sending back a bunch of cables lately for bending and breaking almost immediately, so this pleases me immensely.Update Dec 2015: It still works as well as it did when I first received it. I mostly use it when travelling, so not everyday, but often enough.\\ngreat sounds. works with my tv and phone. Has cable for non BT devices. Connect to cable box makes volume independent of TV volume. you can even mute the tv and use just headset. Works fine with my Galaxy phone and my IPad. If you use Netflix etc connect to your device providing netflix like DVD that provides it for separate volume control. You can also connect to TV of course but Tv volume will not be independent. Distance is limited to about 30 ft usual BT limit. I love it so far.\\nUPDATE – 11/11/2015 – Raising back to 5 stars for the Micro Solar 1000 Watt Pure Sign Wave Inverter – Why? Because Micro Solar contacted me directly and requested that I evaluate a new inverter.Micro Solar contacted me through the Amazon comments section several times when I was having some difficulty with two previously purchased inverters, but we never could figure out exactly why the inverters I received had problems. The only request from Micro Solar for this evaluation was to please revise my evaluation if in my opinion the new inverter worked as advertised. This is purely an independent evaluation other than Micro Solar providing me with the inverter.I can happily say that the Micro Solar 1000 Watt Pure Sign Wave Inverter has passed my testing and evaluation with flying colors.Check the attached video or copy the link below and paste into your browser.https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jg3p5goisuak87/MicroSolarReview.mp4?dl=0The link is to a video I created to show how well the Micro Solar 1000 Watt Pure Sign Wave Inverter is built and how well it operates. The inverter is a compact design for such a powerful pure sign wave inverter, responds quickly to power surges, and runs cool.I’m very pleased that Micro Solar customer support contacted me and allowed me to evaluate this inverter again. I highly recommend this inverter for those looking for a 1000 watt pure sign wave inverter at an excellent price.If you have any questions about my testing process or other questions, please feel free to post a message or contact Micro Solar. I’ve found Micro Solar’s Customer Support to be very easy to work with and am pleased to see they support their product.Sincerely,Todd C.e the green run light came on, the cooling fan came on (clearing the smoke out of the unit), and it was running normally. Very strange. Not trusting it though I\\'ve got an Amazon return label printed and UPS will be picking it up in a few days. I\\'ll order another one because when the unit works it works great. I just don\\'t trust this one to keep running and when I get out in the middle of nowhere Colorado, I want a reliable inverter. I\\'m hoping that this was just a bad unit from the production line and the replacement will be as good as many have posted here.    UPDATE - New unit arrived today. Connected to my two T105\\'s in series for 12v just like the prior unit. Flipped the main switch to power the unit up. Looked good for about 10 seconds, then popping. Pulled the front cover off and slid the bottom plate off. Q8 on the main board is fried. Two for two. This unit is going back to Amazon tomorrow. I\\'ll buy another brand as I can\\'t trust this vendors product. Too bad because it sounds like others have had better luck. Dropping to 1 star.\\nI\\'ve been looking for a portable charger to use during traveling and attending outdoor festivals, and the price for the battery strength cannot be beat! I received PermaCharger quickly and it came fully charged. I had a question about the micro USB connectors, so I emailed PermaCharger for an answer. Not only did they answer my question quickly, they also asked if they could call me to make sure I understood how to use the product and to answer any other questions I had. I haven\\'t had any customer service experiences like that when I buy things off of Amazon. The video I posted is a quick tutorial on how to charge PermaCharger itself and how to use the micro USB connectors to charge your devices.\\nI was so happy with this for about 2 months and then all of a sudden it stopped charging. I\\'m so bummed.**update**I\\'m changing my review because immediately after writing this last review the seller contacted me and offered to send me a new charger. I really liked the charger a lot so I\\'m really grateful for the excellent customer service.\\nI initially purchased this item to power up my Kindle Fire HD, cell phone, and a small portable charger.  It charged my \\\\\\\\\"Tracfone\\\\\\\\\" just fine and also the small charger, even when the sun wasn\\'t very strong (just took a little longer).  I attempted to charge the Kindle in the blazing noon sun, while keeping the Kindle safely out of the direct sunlight.  First it drew power from the Kindle (didn\\'t understand that), but eventually it charged a little bit.    I discovered, through great answers from asking a question here, that the best thing would be to get a more powerful external charger and charge that with the Poweradd first, then use the charger for the Kindle.  I really don\\'t mind using a \\\\\\\\\"third-party\\\\\\\\\" device to get my Kindle charged; in fact, I just purchased a couple of larger ones to have on hand in case of emergency power outages, as we\\'ve had a few bad situations in NJ the last couple of years (ice storm in October a few years ago, then Hurricane Sandy which left me without power for almost a week each).  It\\'s also nice to power up my devices without the use of electricity on a day-to-day basis.    Bottom line, I really do like the Poweradd and am happy to have it on hand.  Another BIG plus is that the Poweradd people really seem to care that their customers are happy and the communication with them is great.  That\\'s extremely important to me when making a decision whether or not to purchase a product.\\nThis review is for two items actually. The Poweradd 14 watt solar panel and the Poweradd 10000 mah external battery pack (here\\'s a link to the battery pack http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ITILPZ4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).    I purchased these items to use for recharging a variety of devices. Several smart phones as well as several iPads and a Kindle. I\\'ve been very impressed with the combination. The solar panel unit is very lightweight and recharges the external battery pack reasonably fast. If the battery pack is pretty fully dis-charged, the solar panel seems to fully recharge it in the course of a day.    I generally recharge all of my devices in the evening and take the solar panel with me to work. I leave the panel on the front dash of my car (I actually put one of the reflective sun shields in the window to keep the car cool and place the solar panel on top of it, running a long usb cable down the bottom and over to the external battery which I place on the center console. This keeps the battery in a cooler area and prevents it from overheating....I\\'ve checked it with a laser temp sensor and by mid afternoon the case measures around 100f. This appears to have no negative effect on either unit.    The only negative I can note on the solar panel is this...there is an outer flap/sleeve where the charge controller is located. Just below the charge controller there is a small pocket, presumably for the battery pack. The pocket is not ventilated so a battery pack, placed in there, for any length of time gets extremely hot. Additionally, if you put a battery pack in the pocket it makes it very difficult to close the outer sleeve/flap and attach it to a velcro strip that keeps everything closed up. The flap needs to be re-designed to incorporate s mesh/ventilated pocket for a battery and make the flap slightly wider so the velcro strip can more easily engage when the flap is closed with a battery in the pocket.    Outside of this, it\\'s provento be a great little device. I\\'ve been using it heavily/regularly for several weeks now (charging the external battery everyday and recharging all my devices every evening) and it\\'s been solidly reliable.    Very pleased with this.\\nI read the good reviews on this was excited to use it. I tried to plug it into the wall to charge, nothing all I got was the yellow charge light for about 15 minutes then nothing. I tried charging it in a wall socket, a power strip, and using the USB port on my computer with the same results. I hope I just got a bad device, and just responded to the companies customer satifaction survey so I will wait an see if I get a response from them and what happens.After contacting the company customer service dept, and voicing my concerning the immeadiatly sent out a new device no questions asked, I recieved the new one within four days, and and now I see why everyone is raving about it, I plugged it in, although it came with a charge in it, and used the next day with no problems. I must also add, that while I was waiting for this device I looked around at other portable charging devices and the cheapest one I could find was twice the price. I have told many people about this and would recommend it to anyone looking for a back up battery system.\\nWhy buy any other pure sine wave inverter? This thing is amazing, super efficient, high quality, low price! I have this in my camper with 380 watts of solar and 4 batteries. Runs the 5000 btu air conditioner all day just with the solar panels power battery voltage stays at 12.3v from 10am to 5pm. The inverter hardly even gets warm fans turn on maybe twice the whole time. The whole time its running the air conditioner its also running the mini fridge with plenty of power left. I can run a 2hp shop vac with everything else going with no problems. Like i said if you want a good inverter at a 1000w inverter price get this one!\\nI have never left feedback before on any item.  i hesitated from buying from this seller since one of the feedback items said the seller was posting false feedback.  i have recently purchased the lg3 and always buy extra batteries for my phones since i travel often  The batteries I have purchased in the past from ebay or amazon for my galaxy s3 or the original droid were never as good as the batteries that came with the phone (even ones that claimed to be oem).  Anyway i figured i would take a chance on these since the cost was reasonable I thought how bad could i get burned.  i received them in 2 days as a prime member.  Both of the batteries took a charge to 100% which other batteries didn\\'t always do.  i have only used one of them for a day now and it is holding the charge as well as the original and i am on the phone all day, mostly reading and screen intensive use as well as calls.  I couldn\\'t be more pleased.  People should leave reviews based upon their experience with an item and not trash someone based on their speculation  rb  update  After using them for about 2 months my impression is even better.  Most aftermarket batteries i have used with other phones are usually inferior to oem. i have only used one of these batteries and it last all day and lasts for my 2 hour weekly flight watching movies on my lg3.  if i am near a power source i will try to recharge but normally i don\\'t even do that.  All i can say is that these have surprised me how good they are!\\nI just purchased the Omaker Dual USB Portable Charger External Battery Pack with 1W Flashlight. I purchased it due to my Samsung Galaxy S4 battery drains too quickly, as an alternative to buying extra batteries.    Pros:    Charges fairly quickly, if sufficient amp wall charger is used (2 amp at least, higher is even better as it can take several hours for a full charge)    Charges your devices 3/4th as quickly as a regular wall outlet.    Solid feeling unit    Fairly bright flashlight    Cons:    The microusb end of the included USB cable cord does not fit into my case, which means I\\'ll have to remove my case any time I want to charge my phone, which is inconvenient as it\\'s a two piece case.    Doesn\\'t hold the full 10,000 stated MAH, but that is to be expected with any power pack. I\\'d imagine it more realistically can hold 6-7k, but I haven\\'t had enough usage to practically test this yet.    The flashlight function is finicky.    The charging could be a bit faster, but when you need juice and your phone is dead on a trip, it gets the job done.    The USB cord that it came with broke almost immediately, with the plastic end of the USB connector coming off. Still usable, but it\\'s a pain.    ---    Overall, I\\'d recommend this product.    I\\'ll be sure to update this again as I\\'ve had more opportunity to test it out on a daily basis. I plan on using it for a few days as the sole charging device (instead of a wall outlet) for my Galaxy s4.    This review is subject to change based on my experiences with the product in the next couple weeks.\\nNot knowing what to expect, I came away surprised at how good this external battery pack works in terms of practicality. It has a built-in 2-mode flash light function that supports both S.O.S. strobe and a still flash and the light is white and usable. But it\\'s nice that I both ports support charging at 2.1A instead of other products I\\'ve used that only have one 2.1A output USB port. Another nice function is the notification battery status light and lights up with a press of the button. It\\'s shaped like a wave which is pretty neat.    The battery pack itself is white and grey on the top and bottom of the battery. The finish of the battery pack is sort of a matte texture, which is a good thing since it won\\'t slip out of your hands while holding it since it does have a substantial weight to it.    Pros:  -Fairly decent looking  -Battery level indicator lights  -2-mode white LED flashlight  -Li-Po battery cells  -Dual 2.1A USB ports for fast charging, but they are not intelligent ports    Cons:  Included micro USB cable could be longer    Max input is 5V/1A in case anyone was wondering.\\nMy phone was having problems: It would shut off randomly (while it was showing that I had a half battery charge - I have a Note 2 - ) I had to carry a charger with me at all times. Sometimes my 4G, 3G, Wifi ect. would not work on my phone (during this time, my phone would turn off as well. I wanted to try a new battery before chunking my phone out the window. I was pretty upset since I haven\\'t even finished paying it off in payments through TMobile. Other than the problems I\\'ve been having with my phone, my service is great.After reading all the reviews of this particular item, some good, some bad, I was hesitant to buying it. I\\'m actually glad I took the chance. I only paid $12.48 at the time for the battery, which included shipping. I\\'ve had the battery (I believe) well OVER a month and I haven\\'t had any problems with it. It actually fixed all the issues I have been having with my phone (shutting off randomly and the connectivity problems). It was the battery all along. Give this battery a try, you will, hopefully, be glad you did. I know others might have had problems but, so far, I haven\\'t come across any. I hope my review helped you on your quest to find a new battery.\\nI was happy to receive on July 21, 2014 the complete, genuine Samsung kit, model EB-KG900WUSTA, containing exactly the same items as described on its box and on Samsung\\'s website for this product, but for a lower price:1. A white charging cradle, model EP-BG900CWU.  Has a micro-USB 3.0 socket and a red/green LED.  Accepts the white micro-USB 3.0 cable that comes with the phone (see below).2. A battery EB-BG900BBU.  Looks exactly like the one that came with the phone, down to the bumps under the skin, except that it says \\\\\\\\\"Cells made in Korea, assembled in Vietnam.\\\\\\\\\"  The phone\\'s battery is assembled in China.  Both are 2800mAH.3. A translucent plastic snap-shut case to carry the spare battery.4. A Samsung travel charger, model ATADU10JBE with a permanently attached cord and a micro-USB 2.0 plug. Its output is 5.0 V at 700mA.5. A paper with the terms of Samsung\\'s one-year warranty6. Cardboard box with Samsung Original hologram.My order papers show mine came from \\\\\\\\\"Mazel Wireless\\\\\\\\\" which is one of the choices listed when you click on \\\\\\\\\"other sellers.\\\\\\\\\"I\\'ll probably never use the 700ma travel charger, as I have several 2 amp chargers available.  I measured the charging current using the Centech USB Power Meter B00DAR4ITE from Amazon [[ASIN:B00DAR4ITE USB Power Meter]].  The charging current was 1.75A, whether charging a battery in the cradle or in my S5 phone, and whether using the 5.3V 2.0A EP-TA10JWE charger that came with the S5 phone or a Samsung 5.0V 2A ETA-U90JWE charger I bought separately (the charger that shipped with the S4 and the Note 3), and whether with different cables.For compatibility, the cradle accepts the micro-USB 3.0 cable that comes with the phone.  This cable itself offers no faster-charging benefit.  The extra pins are just for higher speed data.  The charger that came with the phone has just a USB 2.0 jack with no USB 3.0 pins inside.FYI, the label inside the charging cradle says:Input5.3V DC 2.0A5.0V DC 500mAOutput4.4V DC 1.7A4.4V DC 450mAI\\'ve always bought spare batteries for my cell phones, so it\\'s especially nice for this one to include the charging cradle and carrying case.

I\\'ve posted a Customer Image of the contents of the box.\\nWell, if you\\'re like me, the reason you\\'re looking at this product is because you would like to have something that can actually start your car, not just charge your phone.  TL;DR version: as long as your vehicle doesn\\'t have a large engine/diesel, it\\'ll start it.    I work for AAA, and while they provide jump packs for us, often a Jump-N-Carry 660 or something similar, sometimes they would end up being a little low on juice.  So I figured I would buy a jump pack for myself.  I did some looking around and at the time this maxmade jump starter was being sold for $55, which I\\'m assuming was an introductory rate.  So I bought one to see how it would do.    So far it\\'s done quite well.  The largest engine I can remember starting was a 3.8L that was in a dodge caravan that had a drained battery.  So for occasionally starting most vehicles, this will do just fine.  Though starting vehicles in the winter is more difficult I imagine it\\'ll still be able to start the same ones it can now, though I\\'ll try to update this review during the winter.    I\\'ve only had a couple issues starting vehicles, and I may not have had the best connection the one time.  The other time was when I had already started a few cars in a row with just a minute or so downtime between each, and then it wouldn\\'t start something.  Though this could have been due to the battery, or just the fact of using it harder than it was designed to be.    One thing to note, there are a lot of videos around with products like this starting a vehicle when they have disconnected the battery to prove that it can start it.  While impressive, it is actually more difficult to start a vehicle with a completely drained battery than it is if the battery is not even hooked up.  Take this scenario: you have a vehicle that the lights were left on overnight so the battery has no power in it at all, when you connect a jump pack it will in essence start charging the dead battery.  The power going into the battery is not available to start the car(power the starter).  If you don\\'t disconnect the battery, you may have to wait 30 seconds or a minute while the dead battery gets to a point where it\\'s not sucking the cranking power of your jump pack.  This is not a problem that only happens with these small ones, the guys I work with and I have seen this happen when using some of the larger stuff, where our jump pack was completely capable of starting the vehicle, but the condition of the battery was such that it wouldn\\'t start it immediately.    So at the time of writing this review, it looks like it is no longer in stock via amazon and only sold by the company for $100.  It\\'s still a fairly good deal at that price.  My only concern for this jump pack, and another one like it that I\\'ve bought by Matco, is how well it will hold up over time.  The batteries in the JNC style jump packs last us approximately 2 years, sometimes less.  So if one of these can last about that long, I\\'ll be completely happy.  This is AAA style work though, for an average person that only uses it a few times a year for themselves and random folks they meet that need help, I imagine it\\'ll last quite a bit longer.    Edit Dec 16, 2014.  Alright, well here\\'s an update.  This easily starts my car (04 Hyundai Sonata, 2.7L V6).  And most other vehicles that are similar.  At least during the summer.  We\\'re finally getting into winter so we\\'ll see what happens.  I haven\\'t kept track of what all has started, but a couple would be a 2010 Civic and an 09 Rav4.  Some things I would not expect it to work with, a BMW, especially if the battery is drained.  I don\\'t know what exactly they\\'re doing with their vehicles, I don\\'t know if it\\'s all the electronics, their engines have a ridiculous compression or what, but BMW\\'s are very difficult to start.  Volkswagon TDI\\'s are likely going to be a no-go with these as well.  So here\\'s a way to kill one of these, or seemingly kill it.  One of the other guys was trying to jump start an F150 I believe it was with a completely drained battery (no lights would even come on in the vehicle).  He hooked it up and tried starting it a couple of times and we believe in the process killed the little jump pack.  So as a general rule, if all that happens when you hook it up is some clicking, don\\'t keep trying to start the vehicle!\\nI rarely write reviews, but this one deserves it.  I was hesitant to buy this case and extended battery due to some unfavorable reviews but I rolled the dice and I am 100% satisfied.  I will keep it simple:1) the case fits like a glove and installs in seconds.  It does use the original battery in addition to an included second battery.  You will not use the original back cover.  The case is a rubberized hard plastic.  It is very smooth with a slight rubber feel.  I like this 10 times better than the otter box style cases with soft rubber bumpers because I carry my phone in my pocket and those cases get caught going in an out, not this one though as it is smooth enough to slide in and out.2) I haven\\'t done extensive battery tests, but the battery does double the life.  If you are like me, the oem battery just drains too fast.  Only time will tell if it holds up.3) The case and battery adds much less weight and bulk than expected.  Pleasantly surprised!*One reviewer mentioned that it was difficult to open the cover for the charging port due to the deep recess.  That is true.  If you are like me and have big man fingers and short nails, it may take a few tries to hook the cover and get it open, but it isn\\'t impossible.Overall, I am very satisfied.  I would buy this again and encourage others to do so without question.***Update: 7/22/15I still love this case and battery.  They have held up well.  After using them for a year, I have seen no decline in battery life.A few observations:-The case is a very tight fit.  After a year, the battery is applying pressure making my screen protrude in the center, almost past the lip of the case.  As a result, I am getting another case and battery.  I am sad to see it go, but I don\\'t want to damage the screen.- The case does eliminate the &#34;waterproof&#34; feature, which for some might be important.- The headphone hole in the case is too small for some headphone jacks.- The same is true of some thick charging cables.\\nI love this power bank! I have had it since April and have gotten a lot of use out of it. I have used it when I am out and about with my mom who always forgets to charge her cell phone and it works just as fast as if I had plugged it into the wall to charge and way faster than my car charger. I also used this when I am at work without power. It charged my note 2 (has a large size battery for a phone) and a internet device and had plenty of juice left over (by plenty of juice, I mean it was still nearly full). I have taken this to the lake a couple of times as well and used it to charge a few gadgets. I imagine this would work great for use in a camping trip.ProsThere is not noticeable difference in the speed that it charges your phone.Comes with a handy charger that has multiple heads allowing you to bring only one charger for or keep it as a universal back up.it\\'s portable and can supply you with ample power to charge devices.Where it could improveI would love to see more than two usb ports (two is certainly a decent amount though)ConsIt is a little large and bulky but still fits in a pure so it\\'s not overly large\\nFirst off! If you are looking for a GMRS or FRS radio, these will work on those Frequency\\'s after you program them in.  But! remember that you will need a License for the General Mobile Radio Service or GMRS frequency\\'s, also i should point out that while you don\\'t need a License for the FRS frequency\\'s it is illegal to use them on this radio because this radio will only go as low as one watt and it is only legal to transmit at 500 milliwatt or 1/2 watt on FRS!If you want this radio as a Ham 2 meter or 70 cm band radio, then you have found a low cost gem! The frequency programing can be a bit of a pain, but! if you get the CHIRP software and the right USB cable, it is a breeze! You must have Technician or higher ham License to use on the 2 meter and 70 cm bands!!I did some testing on this radio and the true output is 4 watts and not the 5 as stated elsewhere! Not a big deal! The build on the radio is very good and should last. All functions work as they should.In simplex mode, this radio will transmit about 1 mile in a suburb type setting and much better with clear line of site! In duplex mode i can hit most repeaters in my area with my after market rubber duck antenna, the farthest being about 10 miles away! With my dual band J-pole antenna at 23 feet in the air i can hit repeaters at about 40 miles away with the 4 watts this radio puts out. Not bad!!Over all! A great radio for very little money. A great buy!Update: 8/2/2014  Its been about a month and i have been using the UV-5R V2+ daily for hours at a time. I use it as a walk around and as a base and mobile radio unit. I have had zero problems with both the radio and the 3800mah battery pack it came with! So far this radio is solid!! Good cheap fun\\nI would recommend this case for any traveling businessperson or an individual who needs some more juice in for their phone. I purchased it because I am always traveling and I absolutely despise having to stand next to an airport charging station when waiting for my flight. After using this case for two weeks, I really liked it and I want to share my experience with everyone here with a video I made.The case features stackable battery design that offers a 100% increase to the S5\\'s original battery. UNU has developed an insertable chassis that fits into the back of the S5\\'s stock battery to double the life of the phone. The 2800mAh battery has over 500 charging cycles with the ability to be fully charged in 3-4 hours. This case provides 30% more than other brands I had tried so far with comparable sizes. With their battery stack method, this case only adds a few mm to the thickness and a bit weight, which doesn\\'t affect the feel when you are holding the phone.to. It is important to note that the S5 is no longer water resistant with the Unity equipped.Assembling the Unity is no problem at all. First power down your device and take off the original backing. Next take out your stock battery and stick it in the Unity chassis. Make sure to match up the battery conductors; they will be on the left side of the case. Take your chassis that no has your stock Samsung battery in it and place it back in your S5, again make sure the conductors line up on the left and that you are placing the uNu logo face down into the Samsung. After that just pop the protective backing on, snap the bumpers in, and you now have a supplemented battery!It is important to note that when the Unity is attached it is no longer water resistant. The Unity does not posses the waterproof capabilities that the original backing has, however the case does an exceptional job of improving the S5\\'s battery and protective function. Overall uNu did an exceptional job of bringing the best of both worlds together. I am very excited about this case and I look forward to reaping its many benefits.\\nAt first I was skeptical because I had purchased similar products and found complaints, a lack of phone protection, non-integrated battery charging, and most importantly, not getting the life I expected.Well, first of all, this case is sturdy.  It adds quite a bit of bulk and weight, but you should know that going in, you are buying a massive battery and a massive case to hold it.  I mean, it isn\\'t much worse than an Otterbox Defender series (maybe a bit thicker), but it is still beefy in comparison to the S5 in a Speck case that I was used to.Second, it feels rigid.  I feel like I could drop the phone and have it be pretty safe, something I did not experience with the graspy, thin extended battery cases.  Again, adding some size and weight, but it is durable.Finally, the battery life is utterly amazing.  To get through a full day (6 AM to 10 PM) with my standard battery, I had to always have off Location Services, Bluetooth, Sync, WiFi when not connected, lower brightness, close unused apps all the time, use JuiceDefender to go Airplane mode when the phone was off, follow the &#34;21 steps to saving S5 battery life&#34;, etc. etc. etc.Today was my first full day with the Anker 7500mAh case on.  I woke up at 6:00 AM and unplugged it.  I run the S Health app and pedometer all day long.  I used it pretty average at work until I left around 2 PM, texting, a couple calls, constant Facebook and ESPN checks, a little bit of music.  Then, I turned on the Bluetooth after work before picking up my girlfriend and making out 4 hours drive home for the 4th of July.  I listened to music for about 5 hours in the car over Bluetooth, having Location Services and the GPS app on for this entire time.  I have the brightness hiked up, the Sync on, Power Saver mode off.  The icing on the cake is my girlfriend played Pharaoh\\'s Way slots for a few hours while all this was running on the way home.Well, it is now 11:00 PM and my phone still has 72% battery life having been off the charger for the past 17 hours and used as mentioned above.  This thing may be a behemoth, but it offers the protection and battery life to make it 100% worth it.  I found this case by chance as it did not pop up in Amazon searches, but it is spectacular.  If you don\\'t believe it because of the lack of reviews, look at other Anker products, I also have the pleasure of owning a couple of their USB external battery packs.Thank you Anker, I hope this helps spread the word,Mike\\nVery nice product, meet the specs and my expectation, highly recommend!#################################################################I was looking for a battery pack with enough juice to charge tablets and phones. I bought the RAVPower Element 10400mAh one, it is not bad, but it has a few issues. Mainly the charge speed of battery pack itself. With < 0.7A current, it needs more than over night to charge the battery pack full. Also one fully charged battery pack is not enough to charge my IPAD 3, which has 11600mAh battery capacity.  Its square shape is also too bulky and gets too warm when I charge IPAD. So I gave it to my brother and look for a better one.I found this at Amazon. It looks nice, the capacity is 13000mAH which is more than enough for one charge for IPAD3, and most importantly, charging current for battery pack itself is rated at 2A. so I ordered it. After using it more than a week, I could say I am not disappointed. I am very happy with it and highly recommend to anyone looking for a large capacity battery pack.#################################################################I used a USB current/voltage meter to measure the current and voltage. I tried a few different chargers. With a Samsung OEM 2A charger, the battery pack draws 2.02A and charges in less than 8 hours! It charges much faster than my old one. Then I tried the Nexus 7 OEM charger which is rated at 1.35A, The battery pack draws 1.5A and the charger just gets a little warm. The battery pack got charged overnight (I estimate charge time about 9-10 hours). Please note charge current gets down when battery pack is close to full.I also tried IPAD charger, it draws about 1.2A, which is not as good as I expected, but still very respectful. The apple product is notorious for its compatibility, so I am not very surprised.So in summary, 1.5-2A Android chargers are better to be used to charge this battery pack.#################################################################Now I started charge phones and tablets. I have HTC One X, Iphone 3GS/4/5S, IPAD 2/3/Air and Nexus 7. All phones/talbets are with less than 40% charge. If batteries are close to full, then charge current would drop!-- HTC One X charge current is 0.7A on either port, same as OEM charger.-- iPhone 3GS/4/5S all get similar result. Charge current is 0.9-0.98A on either port while Apple OEM charger provides equal or slightly higher current.-- Nexus 7 draws 1.12A from either port, while with OEM charger current is 1.18A, which is also very close.-- With IPAD 2/3/Air, with 1A port they all draws 0.98A. With 2A port they all draws 2-2.02A, which is actually slightly higher than OEM charger. With Apple OEM charger I measured 1.92A max.Voltage numbers are pretty stable at 4.97-4.98V.For capacity, I charged iphone 5S for 5 times it still has one solid light on. Then I tried the IPAD 3 with only 8% battery left. The fully charged battery pack was able to charge it to full with the the last LED light started to flash. I would say capacity rating is very close the spec and it should get better after a few charge/discharge cycles based on my experience.When I charge IPAD with 2.02A current, the battery pack get a little warm, but not bad at all.#################################################################Here is my summary:Pros:-- Current to charge battery pack itself is 2A!-- Charges IPAD with 2A current.-- Enough capacity to fully charge IPAD\\'s or to charge smart phones for whole family.-- Good looking, not bulky and easy to hold.A few things to improve:-- Make it to draw 2A from IPAD OEM charger which is very popular indeed.-- Make 2 ports equal so I don\\'t need to make sure I am using the right port for IPAD.BTW, I saw some people asked for more USB ports. Remember the more ports, the less current for each port. The total output current should not be very large, otherwise the battery pack would get VERY warm which is not good (life time of battery pack, and risk of fire/explosion). My previous battery got VERY warm that I dare not to charge 2 tablets at the same time.\\nAs with any battery product I know to first charge it for 8-12 hours BEFORE using it.So I charged it overnight then the next day added it to my iPhone 5SI waited for my iPhone 5S to drop to 20% battery and hit the button.It charged my phone to 100% and still had 1 light left.I Charged it again for 12 hours.It now works flawlessly. it recharges my phone to 100% from 5-7%. This is exactly what I expected and this is the result I got.I do not get any warnings on my 5S about it not being compatible.\\nUpdate (Nov 1, 2016): I understand that this was a counterfeit situation, and that the review should not reflect poorly on the ACTUAL product just because I received a garbage fake from a 3rd party seller. I have changed my star rating to the rating the real product deserves.Original Review (June 30, 2014): Seller: SUNWEBSo this is unfortunately one of the many, MANY fakes for the authentic G1W (authentic comes with NT96650 processor and AR0330 lens).I suspected the one I purchased here was fake so I opened it up and of course it is a fake G1W with the much cheaper Novatek NT96220FG processor, and much worse video quality.Read all about it here (and how to help avoid buying crap fakes): [...]DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!\\nNo one in the stores had anything like this for the 5c. I was a bit skeptical due to its one size fits all type of deal, Since the 5 and 5s barley differs in size with the 5c. However, I seen some decent reviews that sold me on taking the chance. I don\\'t understand why people complain so much about products, haven\\'t had the time to charge it yet, but that was one complaint was its time it takes to fully charge. That\\'s nothing to complain about when everything else works great and extends battery life. Also, someone stated that the buttons are hard to push I have no problems what so ever, the power button is just snug in there but nothing too hard to touch on and off with. Not sure how safe it is to protect against falling at high distances, when comparing it to why people purchase expensive otter boxes or mophies. However, mophie doesn\\'t make it for the 5c yet. The way I view it tho why not pay for something that works just as great as the next at a third or less of the cost of the higher end competitors, the product will pay for itself sooner than later. Any way hope this review helps some people who are unsure and skeptical about buying this product.\\nWith so many mobile devices with me, I really need a powerful external power bank to feel comfortable when I am traveling.I have 3 power banks, 2 of them are at 5000mAh, 1 at 10200mAh. I am not satisfied with any of them for the following reasons:1. One of them has a micro USB connector broken so I cannot use it to charge my android devices. I have only used it a few times.2. The second one doesn\\'t seem to have 5000mAh as claimed, it can only charge my Nexus 5 one time (it is only 6-month old).3. The third one is the 10200mAh one, but it is really bulky and I haven\\'t even used it once since I don\\'t want to carry it...I have been doing a lot researches on all kinds of power banks/power packs and decided to give ZiLu power bank a try for the following reasons:1. portable. I do like the slim design which can fit in my hand/pocket easily.2. powerful. 13000mAh with 2.1A/1.0A output and two USB ports.3. components. Samsung battery cells and TI IC chips, it is kind of rare to see these brand-name components in power banks.4. Warranty. 1000 cycles and 2-yr warranty, and it is from Amazon, which I do trust.5. Reviews. Well, there are only 4 of them, but all from reputable reviewers, so I think I may try to be one of the early reviewers.I will update with detailed reviews once I get it, keep an eye on the review!Ok, got it yesterday:1. 75% charged already, so directly plugin two phones: Samsung Galaxy Light (27% battery left) and Nexus 5 (50% battery left).4 hours later, both phones are 100% full.2. The weight is ok and size is indeed smaller (more portable) than the other 3 power banks I have.Continue testing, so far so good with the following devices (charged to 100%):--ipad mini--ipad mini retina--ipad Air--dell venue pro 8--samsung galaxy note II\\nthis case is great for the price. it charges the phone quickly and isn\\'t that bulky. my favorite thing about this case is when you have the case on your phone and you plug it into the charger and click the button on the back, it charges both the phone and the case! works great!\\nI saw some negative reviews on this item, but i believe deeply in zero lemon since i had bought their products before for the note 2 note 3 and gs4Let me tell you thoughFrom the moment it arrived I knew it was gonna be a keeper.I tried it out, put it in my pocket, and sure as hell it gave me a nice bulgeI slapped it on my phone and charged it up(there\\'s nothing like the feeling of a fully juiced up bulge in your pocket to give you all the confidence you need to get whatever u gotta get done when u leave the house)So after 12 hours of charging i took it on its maiden voyage out to the clubFrom the moment I walked in the club I sensed that everyone was staring at me, wondering &#34;what in god\\'s name does that man have in his pants that could give him such a confident stride?!&#34;That night i took hundreds of selfies, made dozens of phone calls, sent hundreds of nudie pics and by the time 2 am rolled by i still had 95% battery.At exactly 2:35 was when history was made.I walked out side the club to criticize people smoking cigarettes in a feminine fashion when i witnessed a mugging in progress.A young women no older than 23 roughly 5\\'8 and with a huge rump was under siege and having her hand bag ripped out of her hand by a dedicated hooligan.I was about to do the right thing and turn around to pretend like I did not see anything so that i could evade physical altercations.But then I remembered about the juiced up bulge in my pocket, with it I was unstoppable.I reached into my pants and with a heroic countenance pulled out my mighty juiced up brick, I jammed it in a spare sock and ran at the hooligan swinging it like a madman all the while yelling out a war cry consisting of 3 short bursts with one long that resonated through the air alerting everyone of my eminent heroism.The hooligan was massive and put up a good fight but in the end neither he nor the woman he was trying to robwere a match for the &#34;ZeroLemon samsung s5 7500 mah extended battery case&#34;.I shortly blacked out after this...Upon waking up in the morning to my alarm clock i reached over to get my phone and silence it when what i saw horrified me.That very woman I had saved last night had made herself at home and started making strawberry pancakes to provide me with supple nourishment.Yes sometimes you have to take the good with the bad, I hate strawberry pancakes.But my new girlfriend has a large rump, and my phone still has 96% battery.Thanks Zero lemon,Your the best.\\nAmazon has a plethora of portable speakers available.  The latest to my collection is the Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 Boombox (SHRK) and the Photive SOUNSCAPE 8 (PHTV).  At the $60 dollar price point IMO are probably the best This review will cover a side by side comparison of these categories....Features, Built/Portability, and most importantly SOUND.FEATURES: Both have Bluetooth connectivity, the SHRK has version 4.0 while PHTV has version 2.0.  Both connected and paired very easily.  Range tested as advertised respectively for both units.  SHRK has NFC while PHTV does not.  Both advertise a 10 hour battery life.  Both boast 10 Watts of power and a passive subwoofer.  The SHRK has controls to pause, and change tracks while the PHTV does not. Advantage: SHARKKBUILT QUALITY and PORTABILITY: Both units are built very well, both have some heft to them.  The SHRK weighs a little more but the PHTV has an all aluminum body which I feel will handle the bumps and accidents a little better.  Both sport metal grills that cover the speakers.  The SHRK is a little over 7 inches in length while the PHTV is 10 inches long.  Width and Height are nearly identical.  Although the PHTV is bigger, by no means it is not portable.  However, the SHRK is smaller and includes a carrying case.  Advantage: TIESOUND:  Like I mentioned earlier both have 10 Watts of power and a passive subwoofer.  Both have amazing mids and treble for speakers of this size.  However, when comparing the bass between the two units, it is evident that the SHRK just puts out more.  This in turn just makes your music sound that much richer.  Advantage: SHRKConclusion:  If sound is the ultimate choosing factor between these two units then I would choose the SHARKK.  Additionally it has added controls and does include a carrying case.******************************************************************************************************************************************************************EDIT June 16 2014:  I have been using this product a lot at the beach, pool and for a weekend camping trip.  While I love the sound of it, there is one HUGE gripe that I have found.  When the battery level gets low, the led begins blinking red and sends out audible beeps every 4 minutes or so.  This is a good feature, as it will let the user know that the unit needs to be charged and plugged in.  However, after plugging in a charger the unit CONTINUED to beep.  I contacted Sharkk about this and they told me to restart the speaker and the beeps should go away. I did as instructed, but I still have the same problem.  The only way to work around this issue is to turn the unit off and recharge it to an \\\\\\\\\"acceptable\\\\\\\\\" level which is hard to determine as there is no battery level indicator.I use this unit outdoors a lot and this has become an inconvenience because now I have to in sense monitor the speaker before it starts to beep.  Although the sound is great this issue brings down it\\'s rating to 2 stars until it\\'s fixed.  Please help Sharkk, your team made the adjustment of lowering the voice prompts, let\\'s work on resolving this issue.  Thank youEDIT June 29 2014 *****************************************************************Ok now this is getting ridiculous, I provided music at a party since there was an outlet available I figured I\\'ll leave it plugged in all night long to ensure I have battery life all night. Guess what happened? After about 4 hrs of playing at 90% the beeps came on even with the charger plugged in! Very disappointedEDIT July 21 2014 **************************************************************************************************************************************************After about a month of emails going back and forth with SHARKK support (I give SHARKK support 5 stars) and having me try various methods of addressing my low battery beep issue, it was determined that I had a faulty battery and they offered a no hassle replacement even if it had already been a month since I ordered it.  I received the speaker on July 16th, gave it a full charge (approx. 4 1/2 hrs) and have played it everyday since for several hours at a time at varying volume levels.  It has still yet to give me and low battery beep.  So all I can say now is SO FAR SO GOOD!  Hope it stays this way.

I got this, because I assumed all the Samsung ones would have the same issue. I guess this one isn\\'t any different. I guess I\\'ll just try a different brand.*UPDATE*Anker contacted me and replaced the battery for free. Amazing customer service when you consider Samsung has just ignored all the issues with the S4, and $800 phone. But a company who sells an $18 battery contacts me directly.\\nAfter a few weeks of rigorously testing these batteries against the original Samsung batteries, I can confirm that they are just as good as the OEM (manufacturer batteries). Now, while I can\\'t vouch for the quality assurance (i.e. percentage of defective units per lot sold), the batteries I received are excellent and are just as good if not better than Samsungs. The charger that comes with it is excellent too (see my notes below for charging tips).As a rooted user, I\\'ve customized my phone to use absolutely no battery while on standby. There are only a few services running in the background, mainly the android UI and OS services. I can go 3-4 DAYS (72 to 96 hours) with one charge. For many users leaving non-scientific reviews, it\\'s likely that they don\\'t have rooted phones, thus their reviews are blemished by phones filled with bloatware and programs that can literally run, update, and use data in the background without the users consent, which uses immense amount of battery, leaving the user\\'s battery life varying greatly from charge to charge, fully contingent upon which apps decide to run without the user looking.Since I\\'m rooted, I have full control. No apps or services run without my consent. Thus, each battery charge is wholly contingent upon how much I (myself) use it, unlike a non-rooted user who cannot make that claim. After testing, I can confirm that my battery life with Caseology batteries last just as long as Samsung\\'s OEM batteries.The charger that comes with it, is just as effective as the OEM Samsung charger. It took me a week to figure out the details on how to determine when the battery is charged, but there is a slight redish glow (behind the blue indicator) that will turn off when the battery is fully charged. I\\'ve found that a battery typically takes about 10-12 hours to fully charge from being completely dead. But, if you\\'re anything like me, it definitely beats being tethered to the wall for 2 hours with your phone and charger.Bottomline, this is a fantastic purchase! 2 batteries and a charge for sub $30 is incredible. I absolutely recommend this purchase to any who has a Galaxy S5. I\\'m a little confused why people who have a Galaxy S3 and S4 are purchasing this item and leaving bad reviews saying that it doesn\\'t work as well, when it explicitly states that this battery is for the S5. Are they absent minded? Any case, if you\\'re not rooted, don\\'t blame the battery because your phone will have a mind of its own and is a slave to the bloatware that Samsung and Wireless Carrier have loaded on to it. If you\\'re rooted with apps like Greenify and App Master to fully control your phone\\'s usage, you\\'ll immediately see that these batteries are just as good for a fraction of the cost Samsung is selling theirs for.Don\\'t buy Samsung\\'s battery unless you like burning money away.r phone and charger.Bottomline, this is a fantastic purchase! 2 batteries and a charge for sub $30 is incredible.

But slowly.  Took 4-5 days (some sunny, some overcast) to fully charge.  Seems reasonable given the size of the solar panel.Also, one of those days there was an enormous downpour...I thought this thing was ruined...non-responsive for at-least an hour.  Then it was fine.  Yay!Only reason I\\'m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I\\'m questioning the capacity.  My iPhone 5c has a ~1,500 mAh battery...and this thing says 5000mAh...so I should get at-least 3 full charges out of it.  After two full charges (with phone in airplane mode), I\\'m down to one blinking light.  Given that, I\\'ll be surprised if I get another full charge out of it (but I remain open-minded).  Will update rating if warranted.Update:  charger was basically dead after 2nd charge of iPhone 5c (got it from 1% to 4%).  Again, phone was in airplane mode while charging.  Seller contacted me after first review with all the song and dance about 25% loss due to various factors being normal.  Okay.  But here\\'s the thing:  I got two full charges.  No more; no less.  Two times 1,530 is 3,060, which is about 60% of 5,000.  So somewhere along the lime 40% of this capacity (not 25%) was \\\\\\\\\"lost\\\\\\\\\".  At this point 4 stars seems generous...but I\\'ll leave it there in the hopes that all other aspects of the charger live up to expectations.Oh, one other thing...the lightning adaptor came apart pretty soon after being put into use.  It\\'s not broken or anything...just wasn\\'t glued together for some reason.Update:  all of a sudden I am getting a message that this charger is not compatible with my iPhone and the charging is very sporadic.  It\\'s going back.  :-(Another update:  contacted pretty quickly by seller who is (unprompted) sending me a new one.  The product may be hit or miss, but the customer service is exceptional.  Seller really stand behinds the product.Final update:  I took this with me on a 9 day backpacking trip.  I kept my iPhone 5c in airplane mode the whole trip (just used it for pictures).  Every day I used about 10% of the batter life (plus or minus) and every night I used this to charge it right back up again (so that there was \\\\\\\\\"room\\\\\\\\\" in the charger for more solar.  I finished the 9 day trip...and this thing was still basically FULL (four lights when on).  With regard to my first \\\\\\\\\"update\\\\\\\\\", I\\'m pretty sure the \\\\\\\\\"not compatible\\\\\\\\\" message was due to the faulty adapter I mentioned in my initial review (it was, in fact, broken).  When I used my adapter from Apple, the charger worked just fine.  Be aware that you will only get two full iPhone 5 charges out of it (not 3 as the math would suggest); HOWEVER, over the course of several days, I can attest that you will have gained another full charge.  I\\'m upgrading my review to 5 stars.  Overall, this is a great product (and the company has demonstrated to me that they are committed to superior customer service).me on a 9 day backpacking trip.

She asked me 3 days later what I had done to her phone because she had not had to charge it in 3 days and she is used to charging her phone nightly.  I told her I just worked my magic.  Please do not tell her I replaced her battery with the (Onite Battery for Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini, Galaxy S IV mini).  I would recommend this battery to all husbands who are tired of hearing their wife complain about the battery life of her phone.\\nI believe this is the most trustworthy phone I have ever seen.It is strong, as seen in my video, and it\\'s waterproof. What are the benefits? You can bring it when you go fishing, hiking, etc. simply because the battery lasts longer and it\\'s safer.\\nHave been using for two weeks and works as advertised. Especially like being able to use lightning connector for connection and charging. Unit is thicker than others but still fits in pocket and holder in car. Only downside is the brightness of the LED\\'s a night when recharging., have to cover with a cloth.\\nInstalled this in my RV. I have a wind generator and solar power. It now runs all my electronic devices in the RV (TVs, computer, ...) as well as I ran an electric weed-eater off it, ran the weed-eater with no problem.I like the remote on/off switch, so I can turn it on/off from inside the RV. The inverter has a cooling fan but it dose not come on until the inverter reaches a certain temperature. This keeps me from using battery power to run the fan when it is not needed.I did not use the battery cables that came with it because there not tinned and I needed longer ones.So far so good, good price on a PSW inverter.EDIT: After having this inverter almost 2 months it is still going strong. I run everything in my RV except the AC and coffee pot. When I am at work I turn it off but when I am in the RV and on weekends it is on all the time.I have only had the fan kick on twice when I was running everything at once. Never had a problem out of it.\\nI say could be only because I haven\\'t used some of the others but I have been using the Garmin GTU-10 for the last 3 years which is a very good LIVE GPS tracking service but the SpySpot TT8850 is better for several reasons.I think some of the negative reviews about this device come from people\\'s misunderstanding of how a LIVE GPS Tracker works.  There\\'s two separate but distinct technologies needed to have LIVE GPS tracking.First is the GPS transponder, this is a passive system that simply looks for and receives signals from GPS Satellites.  It needs at least 3 satellites to traingulate it\\'s location on the earth via lattitude and longitude coordinates. This requires a clear view of the sky or close to it....being near a window in a house or car will work because the signal bounces.  The software in the system then calculates things as your position, and even how fast you are moving, history, etc.  The accuracy of your location is usually only within 20-50 feet - that\\'s just how GPS works, but that should be close enough for anyone.Second is what makes it a LIVE Tracker, the device needs a way to transmit it\\'s location to you remotely.  GPS transponders don\\'t do this on their own, they just triangulate your position and record it.  So what is used in civilian applications for this?  That\\'s right - civilian cellular services, and this is why ALL LIVE GPS trackers have a monthly fee, you\\'re paying for the cellphone service to send you the coordinates of the tracker at regular intervals, and like a cellphone battery usage is very dependent on the need to transmist via the cellular service and intervals of checkins.  You cannot have a LIVE GPS Tracker without both.  If you don\\'t like paying a monthly fee for the cellular service then get a GPS recorder - which will record it\\'s positions and allow you to download it later.  If you want LIVE TRACKING than you need to pay for the service.Why the SpySpot service and TT8850 tracker is the best: After using Garmin\\'s GTU-10 I have something to compare to.  Garmin\\'s service is very good and reliable.  But here\\'s why SpySpot is better:1. SpySpot\\'s live tracking software on their website is rich with features that allow you to configure how you use your tracker and service.  It uses Google Earth/maps, provides device location address, lat/long coordinates, speed, direction headed, signal strength, exact time, has complete history reporting, provides breacrumb trails and a host of other configurations and reporting options.2. Interval tracking only activates with motion detection - this is the best feature by far and makes the most sense.  The tracker when stationary only checks in once an hour, however once it detects motion (the car or host the tracker is on starts moving) it immediately starts the live interval tracking automatically at the times you have them set it.  The default is 5 mins, so every 5 mins you can get updated locations when the tracker is on the go, which are also stored in the history.  You can also email SpySpot and change the interval checkins to 1 min, 2 mins, 3 minutes, whatever you want.  The shorter the interval the more drag on the battery.  I had them set mine to 2 mins and sure enough, the device reports it\\'s location every 2 mins when on the move.  When the device stops moving it goes back into a \\'sleep\\' mode and one hour reports.  This is what makes the battery last so long, and it\\'s exactly the way a Live GPS tracker should work - reporting based on motion.  You don\\'t need to know the location of the device every few mins when it\\'s not moving.3. Battery life is LONG - even at 2 minute interval checkins this device is lasting 2 weeks without the need for a recharge, very nice.  I\\'m sure the battery will degrade over time as all batteries do but they did an excellent job of maximizing battery usage in this device.4. Comprehensive history reporting.  The report functions in SpySpot\\'swebsite are so good that I rarely need to even check the live tracking, usually I just go and check the reports to see where the device has been and in the reports I can see where it\\'s been every 2 mins, it even provides breadcrumb trails showing the direction of travel and routes in the history.  I believe they store the history of your device for up to 2 years.There\\'s not many Live GPS Tracking devices on the market, especially since Garmin discontinued the GTU-10.  I\\'ve looked at others and decided on the SpySpot service and am completely satisfied.  People need to understand the technology and expectations before diving into something like this.  If you truly understand how this technology works and realize what your expectations should be based on that, you will be completely satisfied with the SpySpot TT850.\\nGiven the horrible AND great reviews given by the previous reviewers on Amazon.com, I was hesistant to purchase this battery. But it was either I get this or spend $40 at Batteries Plus for a new one. So I got this one for 10 bucks, charged up to 100 %, let it die all the way down to 0% for two battery cycles. The third time I had to charge it up starting at 4% due to having to work the following morning. However, the first time the battery lasted 63 hours with very light use, the second time almost two days with a little bit more moderate use. Folks, this is a good battery replacement for the Sam Sung Note II, and I would strongly recommend this product to you.\\nAbout ZeroLemonI first used the Zerolemon brand when I needed extra batteries for my old Optimus LG Pro. They offered 2 batteries with a charger and a great warranty. The quality was great and I made a mental note of the company if I ever needed batteries again.Since then I upgraded (if you can call it that) to the Nexus 5. So when I noticed that I could not simply swap out batteries given the fixed cover I was aiming for a battery case to accompany me on business trips. I shied away from all the other brands because, frankly, they looked like they were over priced and not that well rated.When I saw ZeroLemon was planning to come out with this case on March 10th I decided to wait for it and I am glad I did.About this case, or should I say casesI didn\\'t realize that this case was as big as it was. I should have figured it out knowing that it was a 3500mah battery that somehow fitted around the small footprint of the Nexus 5. Don\\'t get me wrong: its not a problem. Not even for my 5\\'5\\\\\\\\\" wife: you can hold the phone just fine but it is certainly a little deeper and wider than you might expect.I decided to do a video where I unpack and pack the phone into the case. It might look difficult but it really isn\\'t once you figure out you are looking a 3 cases:-There is an inner case that consists of a screen protector (thanks!!!) that clicks onto a back. That back has the opening for the battery and the bridge between the battery and the Nexus 5.-Then there is a rubber housing around that: if you drop your phone it won\\'t mind anymore.-And finally, there is a belt clip (pretty big!!!!) that you can click the whole thing into. When it arrives its all clicked together and looks big, but don\\'t worry.Now that I have the phone in it I am fine with it. It still fits in my jacket or inner pocket of my suit and frankly, I find it easier to hold the Nexus with this on.Operation:All the ports and buttons are accessible behind covers. The buttons work better with the cover than without for the nexus as they are more distinctly pronounced.The ONLY problem I noticed is obviously when  you use Qi charging: it does not work for that. Perhaps a next generation of this cover. But I decided it was more important to be able to travel with my phone without worry of power shortages versus NOT having to stick a cable in (that extra second of work is not that big of a deal in hindsight).The protector, even though my phone was already covered with one, works great. No swiping or touch issues.The camera, given the thickness of the case, sits quite deep, but I have not had any issues with photos and flashing: it does not seems to affect it or cast any type of shadow.On the back there is an ON/OFF button where you can decide to charge, which works fine. Ot will show LED\\'s when charging or discharging. Problem I had is that only 3 of the 4 leds worked. It did not hinder operation so I decided not to return. Do note that if I wanted to, ZL would have replaced it. Not sure who would have had to pay for shipping given that it had a manufacturing defect rather than a breakdown at my home. I emailed them on topic just to see what they would say. I will put that in the comments later. IF they think I should pay for return shipping then you will see me deduct a start from this review.Summary:Pros- Protects your phone and then some- Battery lasts through massive video watching and surfing. I can now charge once every 2 days or so.- Provides great grip- Buttons work well- Comes with a built in screen protector- even if you skinned (my Nexus had leatherskin on AND a screen protector) it still fits well.- Has a belt clip with itCons- Might be bigger than the photos suggest- The charging port was a bit tight- Doesn\\'t work with Qi chargersHope the video gives you a view of how it clicks together.UPDATE:Regarding the 3 blinking LED\\'s instead of 4: that turns out to be just an oddity of how the charging works. once the battery fills up more the 4th light goes on. So even if you think, like i did, that the 4th led didn\\'t work, it\\'s actually working when fully charged. All is good.gersHope the video gives you a view of how it clicks together.UPDATE:Regarding the 3 blinking LED\\'s instead of 4: that turns out to be just an oddity of how the charging works. once the battery fills up more the 4th light goes on.

I am very happy with my first test. However, it was not lightning fast as the box said. It seemed to be getting about an 8 MAH\\'s per minute charge rate. I have a Duracell product and it get\\'s double that. However, the Duracell only got me a 73% rating and cost 70% more than this one plus is only 4,400 MAH where as this one advertises 12K. So, as far as speed goes, some are better and some are worse. I did double check to make sure I had my devices in the 2.1 slot so that was not the issue.  Now, here is how I got the above rating.I fully charged the Poweradd before using it. Once is said 100% I unplugged it from the wall and:Charged my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 which has a 4600 MAH battery. It started at 4% and went to 100% which is 4,416 MAH\\'s discharged from the PoweraddCharged my Nokia Lumia 1020 which has a 2,000 MAH battery. It charged from 3% to 100% for a total of 1,940 MAH\\'s.Charged my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; with it\\'s 4,400 MAH taking it from 10% to 89% for a total of 3,476 MAH. At this point the Poweradd went dead.That is a total of 9,832 MAH\\'s discharged from the battery pack. It has a 12,000 MAH battery so I got a return of 81.93%There was another problem and I would have taken off a star for it but I was so happy with the efficiency rating I didn\\'t dare. I thought once the Poweradd got to 1% it was going to be very average. The reason is because at that point I was getting a rating of 69%. It stayed at 1% for a long, long time. It discharged roughly 1,500 MAH\\'s on the final 1% which means either it was a fluke that won\\'t happen again or the readout is not at all accurate. It seems the battery actually had about 14% of the battery left when it said 1%. That was very strange but still worth 5 stars. Sometimes companies monitor these ratings. Maybe someone from the company can weigh in on that issue.Oh yeah, one more thing I wish were different. It charges at 1 AMP, which means it will probably take a long long, time to charge this battery pack. That can be done while sleeping and at work though so not that big of a deal. This is a fantastic battery pack and considering how little it cost it\\'s a phenomenal deal.\\nI had my S3 for over a year and I had grown accustomed to 2-3 hours of battery life with continuous use, and 4-6 hours of life with minimal use. There are things you just adapt to. After realizing that my battery was distended, and I was due for an upgrade, I did some research, and came upon Anker\\'s S3 Battery replacement.I was skeptical at first, as I tend to dislike use 3rd party products, but the number of positive reviews won me over.The product arrived quickly, 2 business days.The product already came with a 40% charge.After fulling draining the battery, and fully charging it, I average between 12-15 hours a day with steady use. With minimal use I racked up 19 hours (which had me at 10% at the end.)The reason I\\'m writing this, and writing so highly, is based upon the follow up from Anker\\'s. They actually sent a follow up e-mail to check to see if I was having any problems. Were there issues, all I had to do would have been to respond via e-mail and I\\'d of gotten support. I gotta say, that\\'s pretty solid customer service.As I\\'ve already mentioned, the product works as advertised, and unless my memory deceives me, I feel the battery lasts longer than my original that came with the product.\\nThis power bank has many positives - bright flashlight, decent power capacity, charge status indicators ( 4 lights), automatically starts and stop the transfer to your phone, MP3 player, etc.  It can supply the full rated 1.0 amp output, but does not switch off early when charging my Sansa Clip MP3 player.  The second press flashlight setting is very bright.  Currently my favorite ( of 19 power banks).  The side power button could be accidentally pressed in a pocket or purse, but it takes a long press to turn on the flashlight.  A short tap lights the power status lights, then goes off again.  Holds it\\'s charge well so far on sleep mode.Like most multi-cell power banks (greater than 3000mah) it re-charges quickly to about 3/4 then slows to a slightly reduced current while the cells are balanced, then creeps up to full power.  It takes longer but should extend the life by avoiding overheating and high currents.  When charging my Kindle keyboard, it supplies the full .85A current while maintaining a voltage of 4.84V - a good result.\\nMy main reason for buying this [[ASIN:B00AAP2U4Y Jackery Bar 5600mAh Portable Power Bank]] is because it advertises \\'2.1A Output\\'. I already own several Power Bank units in the 5000-5600mAh range, but none of them is powerful enough to satisfy my [[ASIN:B00AGAYQEU Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+ Tablet]] which demands 2A of charging current (if it cannot get 2A, it falls back to 0.5A instead). This Jackery power bank unit, however, is able to charge the Nook HD+ at full speed without any problems.The Jachery power bank has an aluminum casing that looks elegant and feels sturdy. It is slightly larger and heavier than my two other power banks units with identical capacity ratings: the [[ASIN:B00A2HD7FG EC TECHNOLOGY 5600mAh]] and the [[ASIN:B00EKHMJLM PowerBot PB5600]]. See the photo I unloaded to \\'Customer Images\\' section for size comparison.I tested the battery capacity of this power bank unit, by connecting a 5-ohm power resistor to its USB port. The unit is able to produce a well-regulated 4.92V at 0.95A (output power=4.67W) for 254 minutes. The total output energy is therefore 19.8Wh, which is consistent with the \\'5600mAh\\' capacity rating (3.7V * 5.6Ah = 20.7Wh, minus power conversion loss). In contrast, my other two \\'5600mAh\\' power bank units did not perform as well:- The EC Tech unit delivered total energy of 17.8Wh (10% lower)- The PowerBot unit delivered 15.0Wh (24% lower)See the \\\\\\\\\"Output Power vs. Runtime\\\\\\\\\" chart I uploaded in Customer Images section for details.Some other things you should know about this product:- The USB power does not turn on automatically when you plug in a device. You need to press the white power button on the side to turn it on.- The 3-bar battery status light only comes on for 5 seconds before turning itself off, even though the USB power is still on. Yoy have to press the white button again to check the battery status.- When the battery is nearly exhausted, the status light comes on and starts blinking.- The instruction sheet says each of the three LED bars represent 33% of battery status, and blinking LED means less than 10% of charge left. Based on my testing, this seems to be an accurate description. Most other power banks I tested have highly non-linear status lights, so for example if only 1 LED out of 4 is on, the battery could be anywhere between 10% and 50%.- To recharge this Jackery Bar\\'s internal battery, you just connect it to an USB power adapter. It takes about 5-6 hours to recharge if your USB power adapter can supply at least 1A of current. If you recharge it from a computer\\'s USB 2.0 port, the current is limited to 500mA, so now it takes about 12 hours to recharge.- The LED flashlight is turned on/off by two quick clicks on the power button. It is nothing to get excited about, though. The beam is dim, greenish and unfocused. On the up-side, it claims a really long runtime of 450 hours.CONCLUSION:The Jackery Bar power bank is well-built, and it delivers the advertised output current and battery capacity. The only drawback is price, as it is currently priced about 60% higher than my two other 5600mAh power bank units. But since I really need the 2A output current for charging my Nook HD+, this is the smallest and lowest-cost power bank unit that works for me.he status light comes on and starts blinking.- The instruction sheet says each of the three LED bars represent 33% of battery status, and blinking LED means less than 10% of charge left.

I only use mine to text my kids or make very occasional phone calls. Thus, I have a T-Mobile pay-as-you-go plan, and as a Gold Rewards customer, I only pay about 10-20 dollars for my phone annually! I bought this phone just because I wanted something smaller than my previous (and older) Nokia. I slipped the T-Mobile SIM card in, and everything worked perfectly. Everything seems to be working fine, the FM radio does a pretty good job, but the TV feature doesn\\'t seem to be able to bring anything in except a fuzzy Spanish channel, if I\\'m lucky (I live in Orange County, CA). All in all, I can\\'t complain about this phone, it does what I need, but if you\\'re a more sophisticated consumer, you may need something more powerful.\\nI bought the Opus BT-C2000 few days ago. NLee the engineer’s review above is very complete (as always from NLee :) ), and accurate from what I have seen so far so I’ll just add my observations.First impression, this Opus BT-C2000 is a very complete charger/analyzer and is easy to use. I got interested by this charger because it advertised the capability to charge/analyze cells up to 20,000mAh and has C/D cells adapters included in the box. I use high capacity C/D cells, so this looked like the right charger to get the job done. I’ve seen review of C/D cells adapters for other charger which do not fit/clip  well in chargers, but the Opus ones are tight are work well. It does handle the C/D cell like any other cells, except for resistance checks (the adapters add resistance leading to wrong readings…)The charger has thermal sensors for both the batteries and the unit itself. Info from the user manual, (I don’t have the tools to verify…), if it detects a temperature of 60deg on a cell, it will pause the on-going operation to let the cell cool down. If it detects a temperature of 70deg in the unit, it will also pause the operation to allow cooling down. This is very nice to prevent damaging the cells or the unit.From an analysis I’ve read, the charge is gentle and seems to give a very nice and delicate finish, adjusting the charge rate toward the end. This good technical analysis can be read on candlepowerforums dot com. I would recommend googling it if interested in more technical details (simple google search “Opus BT-C2000 review”).Once the charge is completed, it goes to a 10 to 15mA rate (seems to be depending of the type of cell being charged), just to maintain its level (I would still not leave the cells there for long periods...).The charge function is set to 400mAh as default, but can be increased to 1000mAh if the 4 slots are used, or 1400mAh if slots 1 and 4 are used for C/D cells with the adapters. This is good for high capacity C/D cells, but still a little long to get a full charge. Being a high capacity D cell user, I would like a bit more, like 2000mAh. But 1400mAh still gets the job done. One observation, when charging my high capacity D cells, it seems to be hovering between 1100-1250mAh, not 1400mAh constant. But still does a good job at handling the charge smoothly. Another observation, I charged Imedion C cells at 800mAh and at this rate, the current was very stable on 800 until going into “finishing mode”.The charge-test function will analyze the capacity of a battery by charging, discharging and re-charging the cell. The mAh values after the discharge function are kept on the display, allowing keeping note even after the cycle is completed.The quick check function measure the internal resistance of a cell in milliohms. One good point, it can measure alkaline batteries as well. I actually had a bunch of alkalines on the shelf and I check them all for voltage & internal resistance, I found out many were too low V or too high ohms to be used.Overall, a very good, useful and complete unit. My only few complains would be:  I wish the slots were C and D cell sized instead of using an adapter, it would allow charging and testing  4 D cell (or 4 C cells) at the same time instead of only 2, and I wish the charge rate would go to 2000mAh to address high capacity cells a bit faster. There might also be some work to be done on the algorithms for high current charge as it does not seem stable.  But these are minor “nice to have” and it’s not enough to lower my rating. The overall unit is very good… I give a fair 5 stars to the product.ith the adapters. This is good for high capacity C/D cells, but still a little long to get a full charge.

The ability to accurately tell how much power is remaining in the battery (rounded to the nearest %) is quite a remarkable feature. The addition of two-charging ports to a rather powerful battery is quite a nice ensemble of features which make this product a recommended choice of mine.The Pulse comes in a glossy black color. Although the casing does tend to pick up your fingerprints, the high-gloss does give it a premium feel to the battery.As far as its technical features, the Maxboost Pulse as a 10,000mAh battery cell which means you can charge your iPhone 5/5S/5C multiple times or charge an iPad or comparable tablet on a single charge. Plus the Pulse has two charging ports for extra efficiency. Simply plug your iPhone in one port, the iPad (or any other USB device for that matter) in the other and the Pulse will begin to charge both. This is a really nifty feature if you\\'re on the go or have multiple products that need charging.Probably, the most distinguishing feature of this battery pack is the LED screen which not only shows how much power is remaining but also indicates whether the unit is correctly self-charging (notated by an \\\\\\\\\"IN\\\\\\\\\" icon), or charging other devices (notated with an \\\\\\\\\"OUT\\\\\\\\\" icon). The screen also features a internal light which highlights the screen in a neon blue.The Pulse also comes with a built-in flashlight for emergencies or nighttime use.I have used this product for a couple weeks now and I have found the Pulse to be a great buy for the cost. The power and features makes it definitely a product to consider when looking for an external power source.One negative, is that it does take some time to charge. I would recommend charging the unit overnight to get the full benefit.For a more in-depth analysis of the Pulse please refer to the video.\\nI purchased this item several months ago and I have used it sporadically since.  The charge (when it worked) was quite good.  It was able to keep my phone charged during normal use and even while using Netflix or Youtube.  As time went on the silver band that wraps around the battery and goes around the usb ports and the charging port became bent or something and you really needed to finesse the cable to charge the unit.The company saw my review and offered to replace the unit.  I got a new one now and it works perfectly.This is a really great company with good customer service.  I am a very happy customer.\\nI had read some reviews about some batteries not performing as well as they should.Just as a bit of background: I got my iPhone 5 on release day. I was a bad Apple user and used chargers that weren\\'t made by Apple. The problem with that is the flow of power going in. If you monitor the power, the Apple chargers are all higher quality than any other that I\\'ve seen. I use my phone like a tyrant. I play a TON of games. My favorite is Solomon\\'s Boneyard, and it\\'s free, and an endless game. It\\'s a great time. After 18 months of using my phone rigorously and charging it was a bad charger I started to notice some symptoms.Symptoms:Phone dying at 25% battery.Phone running crazy hot during video and dropping ~1% per minute (thanks Twitch).Phone not charging to 100% (plug it in over night, only goes to 98%).Phone charging very quickly.Plugging the phone in at 30% and it would jump to 55-60% instantly.I bought this battery. Shipping was promising to take a long time, which was fine. I didn\\'t need a replacement immediately, I needed one eventually, and shipping was free on a non-prime item. It showed up 5+ days before estimated, so I was happy about that.No instructions, but there are so many online that I couldn\\'t complain. The packaging was simple and the battery was separated in a static free pack.More tools than you would ever need. The pentalobe screw driver fit perfectly to take out the bottom screws. The phillips probably could have been a better fit, but it worked without stripping screws. I did lose one screw and wished the package came with an extra, but that was my bad, not theirs. I didn\\'t &#34;lose&#34; it, it\\'s just being safely stored. In my carpet. Somewhere.The battery looked identical, fit perfectly, and my phone booted right back up. So far I\\'ve seen over 100% improvement in battery life. Where normally my phone would be ~75% I\\'m sitting at 89%.The printed date on my old battery was 07/12, and the date on my new one was 09/13, so 14 months newer, which means I should have generally great battery life at least until I upgrade later this year.\\nAbsolutely love this product! I keep it in my backpack that i take to work and I\\'ll be honest,  I\\'ve only charged this thing 4 times since i bought it in November due to the capacity. I have a Galaxy S4 and this device holds enough juice to charge my phone from roughly 20% to a full charge on most work days for 2 weeks before needing to be recharged. As far as charging speed, I\\'ve owned another pack that was faster but not by much. Average charge rate for me is roughly 3% every 2 mins. Put it on for 30 mins and I\\'m up about 50%, an hour and I\\'m fully charged from 5%.One very nice thing about this product is the two usb ports. I\\'f you travel,  you can charge your phone and tablet at the same time with no real loss in charge rate.Biggest thing though is the capacity. 10 full charges for a GS4 or 10 for my nexus 7 when the EC Tech is fully charged.The only con, and I use that term loosely because of its correlation to battery capacity, is its size. You won\\'t be putting this and your phone in the same pocket but throw it in a bag, purse or backpack and you will not notice it. It\\'s about an inch taller,  1/4 inch wider and about twice as thick as a GS4 with a defender otterbox.Bottom line,  if size is your biggest concern, this isn\\'t for you. It\\'s big and a little heavy but remember,  it\\'s a battery. However if extreme capacity and a charge rate that is almost the same as a wall charger sounds good,  this is your battery.\\nThe reviews are for two different battery capacities. The reviews for the 5200 and the 7800 are all together here. Some of the reviews talk about the \\\\\\\\\"Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case\\\\\\\\\" fitting with this battery. This is referring to the 5200, not the 7800. The top of each review says which battery is being reviewed. The 7800 has a nice TPU case that comes with it and it fits nice and snug and has a good lip on it. Just be advised that the Hyperion HoneyComb case will not fit on the 7800 battery. I made the mistake of not seeing this distinction early enough and bought the Hyperion HoneyComb case as well as the Anker 7800 battery. I ended up buying the 5200 from Anker later on and that case does fit perfectly with that battery.I was contacted by the company after sending them an email and posting the review about the cover. I got a reply from them on New Year\\'s Day!!! They more than made this right. Good customer service in this day in age is rare. Their customer service is exceptional.I have posted some battery performance results for both the 7800 and 5200 below.This is for the performance of the 7800 Battery.I got the 7800 battery and fully charged it before first use. The details below are for the first run through. Performance should improve even more after a few conditioning charges.I ran the battery down to 3%72 hours run time (just over)13 hours (just over) `screen on\\' time (full brightness - not auto brightness)*Screen on time was a mixture of reading on kindle (black background), Netflix, and general email/internet/texting use.My phone was connected to wifi almost all the time, with the exception of a 15 minute drive to and from work two of the three days and about 6 hours on another day. Other than that, all connected to wifi. Plus about 7 hours of Bluetooth connected to headphones listening to music.I had location services turned off for the entire 72 hours. (I had noticed that the phone had a lot of wake ups - read that battery use - even when the screen wasn\\'t on. When I turned off locations services I noticed a measurable difference in battery performance. Plus, I don\\'t need or use the location services very often. When I do use it for navigating, which I do from time to time, I turn on location services. I created a toggle and put it in a folder on the main screen and when I need it, I can turn it on quickly).I noticed that the TPU case makes the power on/off button easier to trigger. I turned the screen on by accident often, when pulling the phone from my pocket or putting it away. I noticed it happening with some regularity. There are grooves on the inside that look like it would be an easy mod to exacto knife out the power and volume spots. (Update: I since did this and now regret it. It creates a gap between the case and the phone that would allow liquid or small particles - like sand, I was at the beach - to get into the back of the phone. I have emailed the company to ask about buying a new TPU case).I do like the TPU case. It\\'s got a grippy side but more slick on the back. Easy to hold on to but easy to slide in/out of my pocket.I do notice the weight difference. I did keep it in my dress shirt pocket and it was fine, but not as slim and light as the stock battery, naturally. I do no plan to use this battery for everyday use. I plan to use it for road trips for navigating and not needing to plug in a charger cord. Also plane trips and long days when I am not in my normal work/home routine. I will use it for this purpose with some regularity and this battery will work great for that.This is for the 5200 BatteryCharged it fully and ran it down to 4%66.5 hours run time7 hours and 2 minutes `screen on\\' time (full brightness - not auto brightness)*Screen on time was a mixture of some Netflix,and general facebook/email/internet/texting use.Wifi on most of that time, with a few exceptions; some time connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones for music; location services turned off. (see 7800 review above for further information on location services).The Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case works great with this battery.After having tried both batteries (and the stock, obviously), the phone with the 5200 battery and Hyperion HoneyComb Case feels like it is the sweet spot between the super slim stock battery (that lacks sustained battery power) and the behemoth 7800 battery (that goes forever). This is the battery (5200) than many would use on a daily basis. I plan to use the 5200 and the 7800 for activities outside my normal work day, as the stock battery is sufficient to more than get me through a work day with my use. I will use both 5200 and 7800 somewhat frequently for various other activities that will put me away from a charger or not wanting to use a charger, for an extended period of time.Update 1/21/14 - I just spent a week in Hawaii on vacation. I used both the 7800 and 5200 on various days. I found that the 5200 was more than enough for a couple hours of navigation and still plenty of phone time during the day. This is with location services turned on and no wifi connection. I did use the 7800 on one day that I knew would be a lot more navigation and then streaming some youtube and netflix without getting back to a charger until later in the evening. I had plenty of battery left at the end of that day. The 7800 does feel heavier and brickier, but will go and go and go. I like having the option of that battery, especially if I have lots of navigation planned for the day. It being heavier doesnt matter when it is mounted in the cradle on the dash. But for most long days with lots of phone use, the 5200 will be more than enough.and general facebook/email/internet/texting use.Wifi on most of that time, with a few exceptions; some time connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones for music; location services turned off. (see 7800 review above for further information on location services).The Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case works great with this battery.After having tried both batteries (and the stock, obviously), the phone with the 5200 battery and Hyperion HoneyComb Case feels like it is the sweet spot between the super slim stock battery (that lacks sustained battery power) and the behemoth 7800 battery (that goes forever).

So bought this and works like a charm - just like when the phone was new.\\nI ordered and reviewed the Baofeng BF-F8+ a short time ago.  I really wasn\\'t happy with it for the reasons listed in that review.  It seems the GT-3 has taken care of the shortcomings I didn\\'t like.The upgraded hardware is covered in the description above so I won\\'t go into that.Pros:The radio has a better feel than the UV-5R and BF-F8+ radios.  It has a better contour to it without feeling like a 2x4 or too rounded like a giant Tylenol.The sound is a better.  It has a louder max volume while still being clear and not as \\\\\\\\\"tinny\\\\\\\\\" as the older ones.The radio seems better sealed against dust and moisture.  I wouldn\\'t dunk it in a bucket but the elements will have a harder time getting inside.  The battery fits a bit different and seems to be sealed to the body better, along with the side buttons and plug cover.The keypad lights differently.  Not really a pro or con, just different so far.  On the other models only the numbers lit up, on this one the number and a small area around the base of the keys light as well.  The keys are still the same type of rubber as the previous models.  Some people have reported wear on them but I haven\\'t seen this on ANY of my Baofengs as of yet.  If this becomes a problem then I will report it here in an update.This radio seems to receive a bit better than the others did, including the BF-F8+.  Stations that had static in the past are clear using the same antennas.Cons, not many.So far spare batteries are rare.  Since this is supposed to be a limited run of 50k radios it\\'s unknown how long term support will be handled.The base where the antenna mounts is different as well.  On the other models the connector is elevated above the plastic ring around it.  This allows any antenna that will thread on to be used.  On the GT-3 the threaded part is sunken down into the outer plastic ring.  My assumption is to help improve on the weather resistance since the factory antenna threads down and sinks around this ring.  (Much the same way as a stock antenna on a Yaesu FT-60 does.)  I have an ExpertPower antenna with the knurled base, it will screw down inside this ring very tightly.  So tight in fact it acted as sandpaper and had plastic dust and small shavings embedded in the groves.  My Nagoya antenna however does not.  The base on it is just big enough to bottom out on top of the ring instead of inside of it.  This antenna is not stable on the radio and is only held on by one thread before it bottoms out.  This will be a negative to some people that don\\'t want to switch antennas.  I have a Wouxun WXBNCB (SMA Female to BNC) adapter that fits great.  I\\'ll continue to use the Nagoya on my stock UV-5R radio and order a Diamond BNC for this one.General thoughts:The screen is much improved over the BF-F8+ radio.  It no longer dims to the point of looking burned out when transmitting.  The screen on the BF-F8+ goes all the way black when it times out.  The screen on the GT-3 goes dark but can still be read.The programming cable fit well and worked just fine using the latest version of CHRIP.  Use the UV-5R settings in CHIRP.  The speaker mic fit well and worked as expected.  The radio is a slightly different shape than the older ones and doesn\\'t have the slits in the sides on the lower portion of the battery so you cannot use the older charging bases.  The older radios aren\\'t stable enough to stand in the GT-3 base either.  Yep, one more thing to have plugged in taking up room on the desk that isn\\'t interchangeable with anything else.Overall I like this radio.  I hope Baofeng decides to either keep this radio past the limited run or adopts a permanent version of it.  I will not be replacing all of my UV-5R radios with this one yet for a couple of small reasons.  First is price.  It\\'s still a little expensive at just over $60.  It needs to come down to the $40 range first.  Secondis the accessories for it.  Most of them match up fine but until I can order a spare battery domestically anytime and in any quantity I want then the GT-3 will not be a primary.  There also needs to be some kind of AA or AAA battery replacement pack.  Factory cells are fine, until they are discontinued and can\\'t be replaced.The Baofeng radios get the most use in our house.  My Yaesu FT-60 is a great radio but since it can only monitor one channel at a time it gets less use.  There is always at least one Baofeng turned on all the time here.  I have some important scanner channels programmed into all my radios.  With the Baofengs I can monitor two different county sheriffs at the same time since we are close to the line.  If/when the accessories and batteries become more prevalent then the GT-3 will probably replace the older series in our house for general use, assuming it is put into full production after the limited run.73**UPDATE JAN 9,2014**We (along with most of the country) recently had some colder than average weather when the \\\\\\\\\"polar vortex\\\\\\\\\" descended upon us.  I wanted to see how this radio preformed under less than ideal conditions.  I placed the radio in a waterproof bag and left it on the porch for 2 days.  The high temp for these days was 2°F & the low was -20°F.  For over 36 hours of those 2 days the temp was below -10 °F.  I brought the radio in and turned it on without letting it warm up.  The battery showed 2 bars.  It showed 3 when it went outside but I did listen to it as a scanner for a couple of hours before it got bagged.  Everything appeared to be working as it should.  I hit the repeaters just as I did before and the FM worked as well.  I continued to use it until the battery needed recharged the next day.  After a full charge/discharge cycle the unit seems to be just as it was before it went outside.There will be some that say this radio is weather resistant and I should have left it out of the bag to see what happened.  We also got 10+\\\\\\\\\" of snow with this cold.  I didn\\'t really feel like chipping ice out of frozen plastic.  Besides, if it was coated in ice then I wouldn\\'t have been able to test it until it thawed anyway.This radio is a great addition for anyone who wants a solid radio that does what it should and won\\'t break the bank.  This is the first radio I grab when I\\'m looking for one.  The FT-60 is a great radio but it\\'s a bit bigger and heavier than this one.  If I\\'m leaving the house and want a radio with me then the GT-3 goes.  If I leave it in the car and someone steals it then I\\'m out a $60 radio, not a $150-200 radio.  The GT-3 is lighter to carry in a case, jacket pocket or belt as well.  A micro version of this (similar to the UV-3R+) would be most welcome.\\nA Beast of a battery and Strongest durable case . Honest review belowFirst I would like to thank Bastex wireless for Quickest and Safest shipping as I bought this from India.Battery review belowI want to clear you the confusion you may have with the Scratch cover in the case. I removed it and it is easy to remove. Just remove it making sure you don\\'t put pressure on case. It is removable. So no worriesI fully charged this for 12 hours like Zerolemon saidThe battery was 90 percent after 8 hours and honestly guys I am like pushing this battery to limit.  When the battery reached 50 percent I used it for 37 hours. Guys again I stress that I was using it like crazy to drain the battery but the battery spit on my face saying to me that whatever way I use it it will not drain.After using it for more than 2 months. The time it takes to fully charge ranges between 4 hours 45 minutes to 5 hours 30 minutes. I charge my phone every 3 days once at the end of 55 hours average or when 1 percent left and only during night when I sleep. So charging the phone is never an issue for me. The highest the battery stood for me is 67 hours(heavy usage).finally after 59 hours the phone switched off. I guess for normal using people  the battery will last  at least for 3 daysThe heavy usage I did I will list out below1. The 3g and wifi was on all time2. All sensors and nfc and motions and air gestures to say simply I put everything on3. I watched 2 films (5 hours) in mx player which consumes battery when I watched it in S/W decoding4. I talked on phone for around 7 hours on phone on the whole for full 59 hours on battery5. I listened to music for 6 hours6. Was sending and receiving so many emails as i run a consultancy7. I am a sports buff especially soccer so I kind of like use the dolphin browser and chrome and Internet browser like every 10 mins once checking updates on.latest news across8. I played pba bowling challenge game(high graphics) for around 4 hours overall9.i sent a movie 1gb to my dad\\'s phone through nfc10. The phone remained paired in my car blue tooth during my 3 hours travel.11. I talked through Skype video for  hour& Viber alsoOther than that the galaxy note 3 along with Zerolemon put on weighs 338 gms but the case is one of the best and the buttons might be initially hard to press but in the long run you will like it that way.Last week my phone fell accidentally from 18ft(1st floor in my home). I thought phone is gone and shattered but the zerolemon case saved my phone without even a scratch.  The case is awesome. Don\\'t even hesitate about the weight the case adds to the phone because the extra weight you carry means your phone will never be broken or get a scratch even. I love this product. Thanking god everyday for letting me know that there is a product like Zerolemon that gives me battery as well as a strong case to my phone. I am being extremely honest.Every product has its problems.  Even note 3 is faulty to some customers that doesn\\'t mean note 3 is bad. 98 and more percent of people give good reviews to note 3. Same way Zerolemon is very good to 98 percent and more customers. Lucky I am part of the 98 percent. Ignore the problems be positive and go for it. Zerolemon won\\'t disappoint you. Number of 5 star rating this battery gets is amazing. See this review and see the rating and go for it. Zerolemon is miles ahead of hyperion or Anker.  You will not  be disappointed.Thanks Zerolemon. I have written this for many of you guys to not hesitate buying this. This is the best battery and case that\\'s available.  Just go and buy it.\\n[*Important Note* on Mar 14, 2016]My review was originally written for the &quot;Kmashi KMAX-812 4400mAh&quot; power bank. Now it appears under &quot;Kmashi MP-803 16,800mAh&quot;. I hate it when Amazon (or the vendor) arbitrarily moves old reviews to new and different products. Please use extreme caution when shopping.==== Original review for KMAX-812 follows ====I already have several power bank units in the 5000-5600mAh capacity range. Every unit is shaped like a bar of soap, and contains a wimpy LED passing as \\'flashlight\\'. In contrast, this [[ASIN:B00GRQ8AQM KMAX-812 4400mAh Rechargeable Backup Battery Pack]] has an attractive case design, and features a powerful LED flashlight.[Capacity]I tested the capacity of this KMASHI power bank, by connecting a 5-ohm power resistor to its USB port. It delivered 0.94A at 4.90V, or 4.61W of power for 201 minutes. The total output energy comes to 15.4Wh. I\\'m surprised to see that this \\'4400mAh\\' power bank unit actually delivered more energy than some other units rated \\'5000mAh\\' or more. Here is the summary:- Poweradd Pilot X1 5200mAh: 13.5Wh- PowerBot PB5600 5600mAh: 15.0Wh- KMAX-812 4400mAh (this unit): 15.4Wh- EC TECHNOLOGY 5600mAh: 17.8Wh- [[ASIN:B00DTXA578 Jackery Bar 5600mAh Portable Power Bank]]: 19.8WhAnother nice surprise: although the output current of this KMASHI unit is rate as 1A, it is actually capable of recharging my Barnes &amp; Noble NOOK HD+ Tablet which requires 2A of current. None of my other power banks, with the exception of the most expensive Jackery Bar, can handle the Nook HD+.[Operation]The unit is very simple to operate:- The USB power comes on automatically whenever a load is connected. It turns off in 15 seconds if no load is detected.- A short press on the power button turns on the battery status indicator.- A long press on the power button turns on the LED flashlight at Low power. Another long press turns it to High power.- Two short presses turns on the LED at High power. Another two turns it off.You can do pass-through charging with this unit. That means while its internal battery is being charged, you can still use its USB port to recharge another device. This comes in handy especially when used in the car. Even when the car\\'s 12V battery is cut off, this unit will continue to charge your phone through its internal battery.[LED flashlight]The LED flashlight is very powerful. It produces a well-focused beam that packs a long throw. Based on its relative brightness, I would estimate the LED power consumption to be around 1W in High setting. The product description claims 72 hours flashlight runtime. This must be referring to the Low setting, which consumes maybe 1/4W. (15.4Wh / 72h = 0.23W).[Status Indicator]The battery status indicator has 4 dots. The user instruction says each dot represents 25% of charge. My actual observation showed the status indicator to be slightly non-linear, but better than that of most other power banks.- 4 LED = 79-100%- 3 LED = 44-78%- 2 LED = 17-43%- 1 LED = 1-16%- blinking = &lt;1%[Bottom Line]I\\'m very impressed that this KMASHI 4400mAh power bank out-performs most of my 5000-5600mAh units. Currently it is priced similar to power bank units in the 2600mAh range, yet it delivers nearly twice the energy. That makes this unit the BEST value among all power bank units I own. Oh, did I mention it features a REAL flashlight?I already ordered several more KMAX-812, to be used as holiday gifts.[Update on July 25, 2104]I need to point out a drawback for this product. I have one unit that was in storage for 6 months. When I tried to use it, I found the battery to be depleted. The reason is that there is no mechanical on/off switch, so the unit consumes a small standby current continuously. That means I need to recharge it at least once every 3 months, in order to keep it ready for action.[Update on Feb 23, 2015]I ordered another KMAX-812 (Gold). The new unit\\'s LED flashlight is about twice as bright as the old unit (Red), but there is no High/Low power selection now.[Update on July 8, 2015]My review was originally written for &quot;KMAX-812 4400mAh Shaver Shape Rechargeable Power Bank with 2.5 Watt LED Torch&quot;. But now it appears on the product page for &quot;Kmashi MP828 20000mAh Dual-USB Power Bank&quot; (which does not feature a flashlight). Use extreme caution when you shop on Amazon.[Update on Oct 25, 2015]I noticed Amazon finally moved the new MP828 to its own page. So now my review is for the correct KMAX-812.

It changes my 5S about 4 times before it gives up2, It uses the same iPhone power line so I don\\'t need to carry yet another adaptor3. The flash outlet has changes to accommodate that of 5S and works very well no foggy flash pictures4. The lid, thought a bit flimsy, does a great job of protecting the screen and letting the audio out while closed5. The speaker and microphone outlets do not muffle sound and allow very good sound pass-through6. The form is very very slim,  It looks really tiny and unless you look for where the battery is hidden, it is hard to detect7. Great priceCONS1. The audio jack is too narrow for a standard jack and no adaptor is provided. So basically no earplugs!2. the top corners of the iPhone are not protected and thus makes the phone subject to damage if dropped on its head3. Easily scratches and exposes the white layer beneathI think this is still a great covered battery case at any price, let alone it\\'s almost unique.  definitely recommended.\\nJust got this case. Charged for the full 12 hours, and about halfway through the first day (~6 hrs) with regular use (over an hour screen time, half an hour streaming pandora, 5 minute call) I\\'m still at 93%.Pros:-Fits in my pocket (slim Levi\\'s jeans), no thicker than my old Nokia flip phone-Great battery life so far-Case fits very snug and feels solid-Volume rocker feels greatCons:-Power button is tough to press. At first I assumed I didn\\'t seat it properly. However, after taking the case off completely and putting it back on, I still have to push really hard for the case button to make contact with the power button.Update 12/15:Cleaned up my review a bit.First charge lasted about 2 days 12 hours, but skewed by unusually high usage on some apps.On second charge now -- 89% after 15 hours, 3 hours of screen on time.\\nWith all the bad reviews on the counterfeit batteries I examined this one really closely.  It is original and performs as such.  I already had 2 batteries (1 that came with the phone and one from BestBuy)  so I was able to compare them closely, not only in performance but dimensions etc.  I\\'ll be ordering more from Simple Cell while they still have them.Note:  All 3 had different country credentials so don\\'t think that makes a difference.  I have a Japan/China a Korea/Korea and a China/China.  There are normal differences in the water indicator as well.  Hope this helps.\\nThis worked great!  I took it backpacking and hooked it to my pack.  I used my iPhone GPS app to track my progress.  That night in camp I recharged my iPhone and was able to track my hike the next day.  The thing stayed fully charged the whole time.  I would recommend it to anyone.\\nonce charged for the first time from the wall outlet it charged my cell phone many times before I even used 50 percent of the charge. It charged itself during the hike while it was cloudy out. So far I have yet to completely drain it down while charging my cell phone and my wife\\'s. great purchase. I will be ordering another one in the future so we will be prepared for the zombie apocalypse.\\nAfter reading all the good comments and reviews on EC TECH power banks, I decided to give the 22400mAh one a shot. Im not sure if I received a faulty set but this power bank that I received is full of issues.I charged this power bank overnight upon receiving it(that\\'s more than a 12 hour charge and the LED lights indicated that it was at full charge) so I highly doubt that the issues I have is due to lack of charge.1) It only charges my Galaxy Note 3 to 96% and then stops charging it completely. Tried the provided cables and my own, same problem. I used my phone a little to a battery % lower than 96% and tried charging again and viola! Once again it only charges my phone to 96% and then stops2) I tried using this to charge my Note 3 official extra battery kit. it charges for a few seconds and then stops. tried stimulating the power bank by pressing the \\\\\\\\\"charge indicator/led flashlight button\\\\\\\\\" and it charged the kit once again for a few seconds and stopped the moment the led lights went off.3) Tried charging 2 devices at once with the 2 usb ports, my Note 3 and a Cowon Z2 MP3 player. It only charges for the few seconds that the LED indicators were on and stops the moment the led indicators went off.Once again, I do not know if my product is faulty.EDIT: I contacted ECTECH about my issues and was promptly replied by the friendly staff who helped me through the troubleshooting.They had even offered a full refund via amazon or an exchange to another model when it was affirmed that my unit had issues. However, shipping back the item for a refund/exchange meant that I had to pay a lot for the shipping and the understanding manager agreed to give me a full refund without returning the item! This is what great service is all about! 5 Stars for a great company that values its customers!\\nI\\'ve charged my iPhone 5s three times, my husbands 5s once, my old iPhone 4s two times, my son\\'s 4s once, my husbands old 4s three times and I\\'m charging my husbands iPad as we speak. I\\'m going to try my iPod Classic tomorrow. I\\'m shopping for a business gift and need to buy 28 or so. I do passive research for a business holiday gift all year long then act on it around late November/early December. I buy singles of a few top contenders, test them out, agonize over niceties and settle on one.One of the best features I like on the Jackery Mini is the four lights that show the level of charge it\\'s holding. I know it\\'s a small thing, but it\\'s something that makes it uniquely smarter than others with just a \\\\\\\\\"dumb light\\\\\\\\\". That\\'s the light that\\'s either on or off and that\\'s pretty much it. I also like that it\\'s square and doesn\\'t roll off the table. Love the color, works for both men and women. Satin finish, anodized aluminum looking, rich, deep orange, not a happy, cheerful orange.  I read some people have had issues with ill-fitting USB (I read all the one star reviews first) but I didn\\'t have that problem. I did notice that there is a rise in warmth in both the Jackery and iPhone when charging but not nearly as warm as my MacBook Pro gets. I find the warmth quite pleasant in the winter. Packaging is nice too, feels high-end with good photography and typography. Very Apple-esque. Good packaging helps with the like-ability of a present. Finally, I like that it isn\\'t one of the products that has thousands of reviews. I\\'m into supporting a smart product that\\'s just starting out on Amazon. And this makes it less likely that the receiver already has this one. If they already have a similar one, they might be inclined to keep this one. If not, it\\'s very re-giftable.Not sure about the double cord problem. One cord to charge the Jackery, another cord (Apple\\'s) to connect the Jackery to my iPhone. I assume that would be an issue with any similar chargers.(Makes a tangled mess in my purse with my earbuds.) Guess I\\'ll use a temporary inelegant solution like a snack size ziplock bag.The included cord charges the Jackery. The proprietary end fits the Jackery and other is USB. I attach my Apple USB Power Adapter and plug it into the wall socket (or you can just plug it straight into your laptop to charge). Also, I still don\\'t know how long the Jackery will store a full charge. I guess that\\'s TBD.\\nI knew when i ordered this i would test it as soon as i got it.It works! Flawlessly! Check it out!\\nThis battery uses high quality power cells and it lasts a lot longer than my other company\\'s power pack. It\\'s wonderful!\\nI have had an extended battery for every phone I have ever owned for the last 10 years, and I can tell you I have gone through a ton of them.  On my IPhone 4 & 4s I used a case that I personally thought would never be matched again.  I was wrong.  Do I think its a great case & extended battery?  Yes.  Do I think there could be improvements?  Yes.  The following is a description of the case, and reasons I really like, and dislike the case:Like #1:  The battery case is the same basic size of the IPhone 5 itself.  Its basically like taking an I5 and attaching another I5 to it.  I had a case from ICONONIC, which seemed to be a good case at first, but things started failing on it.  This case is great because its a completely separate unit than the phone.  Its not connected to the phone at all, giving you the feel (other than having an extra thick phone) of the actual one.Dislike #1:  The buttons on the side and top are far receded, making it difficult to turn up and turn down the volume, or put the phone on vibrate.  Its not a deal killer, just one of the things I don\\'t like.  Some cases come with a cover over these buttons which makes it easy to use these buttons or switches but still protecting them.Like #2:  The cost  was only $30, which I felt was great considering the ICONONIC was $50.Dislike #2:  Its very difficult to remove the case from the battery itself.  If you ever want to clean the phone, removing the case is a hardship without breaking something.Like #3:  The size of the battery is 2000 mAh, which is basically the exact same size of the I5, which will double the life of the current phone capacity.Like #4:  One of the really cool things about this case is that you have a plug that comes out of the case, and plugs directly into the charging port, which just happens to be the correct type of charging cord (which means you wont get a message on your phone reading **This accessory isn\\'t supported by this phone**)  I really like this because it leaves the port available for if you want to plug the phone into your computer, and simultaneously charge the case!  --  I use my phone a lot, and I need the extra battery.  One thing that I have fell in LOVE with about this case is that instead of only being able to charge one at a time, you can charge both batteries simultaneously, which is really beneficial.  Instead of having to wait 3 hours for my phone and case to charge completely, I only have to wait 1 1/2 hours, and they are both ready to go again!  It is great, especially when you are sitting at the office, waiting for your phone to charge enough so that while you are out, you wont have to worry about your phone dying!!Like #5:  The case extends about 1-2mm above the glass itself, which is great when your phone gets dropped or gets slid on the glass side, the glass never gets hurt or scratched.Like #6:  The case comes with 2 phone cases... One black, and one Blue.  I like this because if one breaks for some reason, you can always use the other one as backup, rather than having to buy another entire case! :)Like #7:  All ports are very easily accessible, especially the headphone jack.  Every other case I have ever had makes it difficult to access the headphone jack.  This case makes it super easy to access it, not only with the standard IPhone Headphones, but even aftermarket headphones.FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS - A few things I would like to see on the next SKIVA case are:#1, a case that can be removed from the battery, but still remain a protective case without the battery base.#2, plastic buttons similar to other cases making it easier to control the volume and the vibrate switch.Other than the few improvements, and 2 dislikes, its a great case.  I have already purchased another one as a backup, or as a gift to a friend.  You cant go wrong for the price!! :)Keep up the goodwork SKIVA!!\\nI just completed my first week with the Caseology brand batteries and charger. Although I have not tested them in any scientific manner, through casual use, they are matching discharge and charge times of the OEM battery so far.I usually stick with the Anker brand, and I did order one of their batteries as well. I decided to try out the Caseology package because it was half the price of Anker, and the Caseology bundle included an external charger (Anker has not released an external battery charger for the Galaxy Note 3 yet).For the price, I am VERY pleased with them so far. If anything changes, I will definitely be back to add more to this review.\\nI used Lenmar for my iPhone 4, so I eagerly waited for them to release a version for the iPhone 5.  While I waited, I took the risk and purchased the Maxboost Fusion Detachable External iPhone 5 Battery Case.  The first Maxboost broke within 3 weeks and the replacement they sent (great customer service) broke 3 days later when I dropped it.  (2nd was my fault)  I decided to go with another brand and then saw the Lenmar was finally available.I have now owned this since August 13th and I have experienced zero problems.  The battery life is actually more than expected.  I do a lot of hiking and leave my GPS running on my phone so I can have a GPS record of my hikes.  After 7 hours, the phone was still at 100% and the phone was showing a blue LED (roughly 25-50% charge left)Likes:Solid case provides decent protectionVERY long battery life for my usageComfortable to holdDislikes:Adds a little bit of bulk, but that is expected with battery caseCharging does take a little longer than I expected, but I charge it overnight, so not an issue for me.I saw an earlier post where someone mentioned the top part breaking for them.  I make no judgment, but mine slides into place smooth as silk.  If I do not have it aligned properly, there will be a little bit of resistance and I know to realign.  My top piece is not flimsy at all.  In fact, it is hard plastic that barely flexes.Lenmar might be a lesser known name than Mophie, but if they continue to make quality cases, that might change.Thanks for taking the time to read and I hope you appreciate this case as much as I do.\\nThis Speaker Is awesome in the sub $30 range. For the price you will not believe the sound that comes out of it. That being said this is not a Beats audio Product or Bose By any means. But it is still very impressive for the initial cost vs. value.Pros: Small. light. Cheap. Feels very sturdy. comes with all you need. unbelievable sound quality.Cons: Heavy Bass songs will distort it a full volume. so far that is the only con IMHO. So this all being said this would be a great addition to you BT capable mp3/smartphonethe price was great the shipping was quick and once again the cost vs. value is unbelievable!!!!! this is a highly recommended product for thrifty audio buffs.\\nThere are a lot of inexpensive iphone charging cases out there that do not work with ios7.  I know because I have returned 3 of them.  However, this case works just fine with ios7 and the iPhone 5s.  I also like the way it easily attaches to the iPhone.  There is no top piece to fumble with putting on like on Mophie products.  I like the simple slide-in design.  The other great feature of this product is that it charges with the iPhone lightning charger.  This seems like a no-brainer for a product design, but it is really hard to find.  Even the $100 versions don\\'t do this.So far, I highly recommend this product.  As of yet, I can\\'t comment on its longevity or how many hours it will add to the life of an iPhone charge.  I will post a follow up when I have had a chance to use it more than once.  I just thought y\\'all would like to know that this definitely works with ios7.\\nNormally my Note II battery is good enough to last the day, but once in a while I need a little extra.  I was looking at the Anker Astro Slim2 and Slim3 since they are supposed to be the best.  I was almost ready to buy one until I started reading some of the 1 star reviews.  Most of them have to do with the micro-USB connector was too big to fit thru the phone case.  After that, I realized that there is no way this thing will fit thru my metal bumper narrow opening for the micro-USB port.  It would not have been a big problem if I could remove the case easily but it is held together with screws.So I started looking again, then I found the EasyAcc 5000mAh.  The connector looks like it would fit and it seems to have good reviews.  So I gave it a try.  I have to say this thing is really really well built.  It feels really good in the hand and the rubber like surface gives it a good solid grip.  The first time I used it, charged my Note II from 50% to 90% in about 1 hours and it still have 2 lights + 1 flashing of charge left on the pack.  To be honest, I don\\'t really care if it has 5000mAh or 4000mAh as long as it could charge my phone (3200mAh) for 1 full charge I am happy, and it looks like it could.Last week, I saw the Astro Slim2 on sales so I bought one for my niece.  She has a Note II too but she doesn\\'t use a case.  I bought it so I could see what I missed by not getting the Slim 2.  I posted some pictures to compare the two.  The Slim2 is a little smaller, but the surface is not rubber like.  It is more hard plastic and more slippery.  When you put it next to the back of the Galaxy phone, it slips a bit where the EasyAcc is glue to it.  I don\\'t use the flashlight on the EasyAcc, but it is nice to know there is one.  The usb connector on the Slim2 is kind of hard to put back into place.  The EasyAcc one is very easy to just stuff it back into the ditch; but it harder to get it out.  You will need long fingernail.There is a huge difference in the built in connector size.  The Slim2 one is about twice as big in both width and height!  I found it hard to believe it would fit thru any kind of case.  It is really big.  The EasyAcc, on the other hand, is about the same size as any normal micro-usb connector.  If you have a hard to remove case, I would suggest EasyAcc instead of the Slim2 unless you are sure that the connector would fit or you don\\'t plan to use the built-in connector.\\nThis device is really great,It can charge the ipad for one full time.It can charge the mobile phone 5 times.It takes 10-12 h to be fully charged.It has a powerful lamp.Thanks.\\nAwesome little portable speaker for the price! Perfect travel companion for any device! Love the design and color. A must have for any one looking to have reasonable sounding speaker without hurting your wallet..Quick Product look: comes in a small box with manual, usb and audio cable, speaker and carrying pouch!Pro: rechargeable long battery life, small compact, bass packs a punch even at its highest volume virtually no sound distortion, its loud for its small size, recharge fast, and carrying pouch!Cons: the cord attach to the speaker is really short,only can charge with usb charge, no bluetooth but thats ok with me...Suggestion: hold the power button a few seconds to power up and blue light appear. Some reviewers did not like this feature but i like it because it eliminates accidental power ups when traveling. I totally recommend this little speaker it works extremely for the price! I am going to buy more!!!Here\\'s a small video testing Kinivo ZX100 pocket speaker\\nI chose this product solely based on the price range as I was just looking for a small bluetooth speaker for my iphone to use while showering in the mornings. This product only had 1 review but I took a chance and am very pleased. The small unit connected flawlessly with my iphone via bluetooth and offered a very crisp clean sound. I was surprised by the quality of the sound and also the quality of the unit. I would definitely recommend!!\\nI had some problems with the wall charger and wrote a review here giving the product 2 stars.  However, within a hour of posting the review, the company manufacturing this product emailed me directly to resolve the issue.  Ironically, a few days after buying it, I got a call at work asking how I liked the product and if there were any issues -- and asked if I\\'d write a review once I used it.A replacement has been overnighted for the wall charger -- to charge the battery used to charge my devices.  I have to say, this is some of the best customer service I\\'ve seen for a product that cost $35!  I will gladly buy from them again.As for the battery?  I go for 50 to 100 mile bicycle rides and use GPS and a bluetooth heart monitor.  Battery runs down quick.  I picked this up, got a 6 foot iPhone cable and secured the RavPower in my underseat bag and ziptied the cable to my phone mount.Since getting this, all my problems with batteries running out has been gone.  In fact, the greatest thing is that I can charge my friends phones as well (if they brought their cable), and still not worry about my own phone running out of juice.  Just plug in the other cable, throw both into my seat bag and off we go.Great product, great customer service!eah...not going to happen...\\nGreat product. I had a difficult time finding an external battery that didn\\'t cause a red x appears over the battery icon on the Galaxy Note 10.1.  With other external batteries I was able to resolve the issue with an adaptor, but it\\'s great not having to worry about one extra peripheral adaptor.  Anker\\'s USB output S, (which stands for Samsung), with circuitry designed for the Samsung Galaxy Tab worked perfectly!  Hope this helps other Note 10.1 users!\\nI almost did not purchase this item because when I read the reviews everyone was saying that you are unable to use the charger unless you remove the phone cover no matter how thin the cover was.  After reviewing other products I came back to this charger and decided to purchase it and deal with removing the phone cover everytime I used the charger.  But when I received the product I read the instructions and found out that there is a piece that can be easily popped out to make a phone with cover fit nicely.  So I request anyone that looks at purchasing this product but that reads everyone elses comments about not being able to use a phone with cover to buy this product anyway and read the instructions that apparently other people decided they did not have time to do.  But had time to give bad reviews of the product.I love this charger and will be purchasing another one for the office!!\\nDon\\'t let the other reviews sway you away from this accessory. I couldn\\'t be happier. Let me address the concerns that you might have.First and foremost, performance: I followed the directions and gave it a 12 hour charge before first use and then let it run all the way down before I recharged it the first few times I used it. I can easily go 2-3 days now without a charge, and that\\'s with full brightness, wifi and bluetooth on all the time. Basically it does exactly what you\\'d expect, last several times longer than the original battery. Now let me address some concerns other reviewers had. This was my personal experience, which seems to differ from some other people who got this battery/case.1) The weight. Some reviewers are complaining about how heavy this battery makes the phone. Of COURSE it\\'s heavier. You\\'re putting in a battery that\\'s basically 3x the stock battery. So imagine three of those strapped on the back and thats about what it\\'ll weigh. Mine weighs about 12 oz now.2) Signal Loss I haven\\'t noticed any signal loss at all. I\\'m still almost always connected to Verizon\\'s 4G LTE, and have no trouble connecting to my home wifi.3) The cuts of the case. The cuts on mine are all dead center and give a wide enough space at the top to connect even my fattest headphones.4) Durability: Like someone else mentioned, it\\'s no otter box, but It feels sturdy in my hand and I feel confident that it could handle a pretty substantial drop. The bevel also goes slightly above the face of the phone so you can set it face down without setting the screen directly in contact with the table or whatever.5) Sound Loss: You don\\'t LOSE volume, but since the battery cover covers the original speaker the case pipes sound out of the bottom of the phone instead of out the back...I like this better, and I swear it\\'s louder than without it.My only nitpicking complaint is access to the volume rocker and lock button. They press easily but are so buried in the case you don\\'t get any feedback that you have pushed the button. I like to feel it click, which i can\\'t now, but that\\'s just me.All in all its perfect for me, and I may even buy another just in case I feel like I wanna go a full week without having to plug in\\nPrior to the purchase of this [[ASIN:B00CW5359E PowerAdd 2600mAh Power Bank]], I already have several similar products, such as the [[ASIN:B00A7BPMMS Black Lip Gloss 2200mAh Universal Mobile USB Portable Power Bank]]. The main attraction of this PowerAdd unit is that: it comes with a detachable LED flashlight module. That means for the same price, I get to have a flashlight for \\'free\\'. Better yet, in case of emergency, I can even attach this LED module to my other USB power bank unit, and get another LED flashlight instantly!As a USB backup power bank, this PowerAdd unit works exactly as advertised. It can produce a 5V output at up to 1A, and its battery capacity is estimated to be around 2600mAh. Here is how I estimated its capacity:I used this fully charged PowerAdd unit to recharge my [[ASIN:B00BIYG6U0 D2-721 7-inch tablet]], which has a 3000mAh internal battery pack. The starting battery status of my tablet was 26%. I let it charged for nearly 4 hour, during which I only power up the tablet once every 15 minutes to check the progress. The final battery status reached was 96%, which means it replenished 70% of the tablet\\'s battery pack, or 2100mAh.But why does this PowerAdd \\'2600mAh\\' power back only recharge my tablet\\'s battery pack by 2100mAh? This is because the charging process involves two power conversion stages: First, the PowerAdd unit\\'s internal 3.7V battery has to be boosted to 5V at the USB port. Next, the 5V at USB port is down-converted to recharge the tablet\\'s internal 3.7V battery. Even if each conversion is 90% efficient, you still lose 20% energy in the process. 80% of 2600mAh comes to 2080mAh.The PowerAdd unit has only one Red/Green LED status indicator, but it conveys a lot of information:- During charging, the LED blinks Red. It stays solid Red after charging is done.- During discharging, the LED stays Green initially.- When the battery is less than half full, the Green LED blinks at once per second.- The Green LED goes off when the battery is completely out.One minor concern I have is that: it takes a very long time to recharge this power bank through micro-USB port. The charging current is supposed to be 1A, so I expect it to take just 2.5 - 3 hours to fully recharge the internal 2600mAh battery. In real life, it took around 5 hours before the Red LED stopped blinking.Overall, I consider this PowerAdd power bank charger unit a good value (4-star). Added one more star for the detachable flashlight unit.[Update on Oct 8, 2013]I measured the runtime of the LED flashlight to be around 9 hours 45 minutes. Its power consumption is therefore estimated at 0.75W, based on my energy calculation.s at once per second.- The Green LED goes off when the battery is completely out.One minor concern I have is that: it takes a very long time to recharge this power bank through micro-USB port.

This charging bundle makes it incredibly easy to manage your BlackBerry\\'s power.It may not be completely clear on how this works from the pictures and description, so I\\'ll breifly summarize.Rather than plugging a microUSB cable directly to your phone from a power adapter, you plug this charging bundle to the microUSB port on your phone.  It\\'s small enough that it fits nicely against the back of the phone, and very easy to use even with one hand while connected.What happens is, the battery inside the charger bundle...charges the battery inside the phone.The charger bundle also has a microUSB input where you can charge the battery inside of it as well.  So ideally, what you\\'d do is something like this.Power Source [Wall Socket] ---&#62; Charger Bundle ---&#62; PhoneWhen both the phone battery and the battery in the charger bundle are fully charged, you\\'d obviously disconnect the charger bundle and use the phone as normal.  Keep it close though, because here\\'s the beauty; In the middle of the day when your phone battery runs out, rather than having to tether it to a wall socket to charge, or deal with removing and replacing the battery with the fresh one, you simply take the charger bundle and plug it into the phone, allowing the battery inside the bundle to charge and power the battery inside the phone.  All while you\\'re still out and about and moving around.I always keep this charged at night and plug my phone into it, so in the morning, I leave with fully charged batteries that were charged at the same time.\\nI purchased this item about 8 months ago. for my cell phone.  I LOVED it.  It would charge my phone 4 or 5 times without needing a charge.  All of a sudden a month or so ago,  it won\\'t even give me 1 charge.  After plugging in the phone and pressing the button,  all 4 lights light up,  then I get about 25% charge and it\\'s dead.. press the button,  no lights. I just contacted Anker and left comment.  I hope they have a solution.  If they do,  I\\'ll give it 5 stars.update 03.02.14: sorry I didn\\'t update sooner.  I emailed Anker and told them about the problem. They emailed me right away, asked for the model# and my address. They sent me another charger and didn\\'t make me go to the post office and pay to return the old one. Then they emailed me a week or so later to make sure I got it and to see if it was working properly.  I emailed them back thanking them for their awesome c.s. and told them that it\\'s working great. I get 2 or 3 charges on my tablet or several on my phone with 1 charge. I not only would do business with Anker again, but I highly recommend them, their products and their c.s. is 2nd to none.\\nI read the negative reviews and was concerned that these batteries would not be as advertised. For $9 I was willing to take the risk. The batteries arrived on time and they work fine. I had none of the problems described in some of the other reviews. The charger is excellent also. The batteries take about 6 hours to charge and run almost as long as the Samsung factory battery. I got 3 batteries and the external charger for $9. This is an awesome deal! As s police officer, while on duty I don\\'t usually have access to ac or usb power to recharge. I simply swap batteries and can go for a long time without ac power.  I\\'m very pleased with these batteries.\\nThis is the best thing I have ever seen. It charges my phone faster than plugging it into the wall. I charged it during lunch one day. Started out at 30%. When I checked it after, it was at 70%. How awesome! This thing is a MUST HAVE!!!\\nThis works perfect!  I mainly got it for a back up charger while traveling camping and in my purse as needed when I am away from a charger.  I have had no problems and I love the way it works.  It charges quickly.  It does not charge completely to 100% unless you start sooner than I did.  I started the charge on 19% and got it to charge up to 91%  I think that is pretty good.  I recommend this to anyone who is wanting a portable charger.\\nMatte finish is nice, but plastic buttons and top of the sliding case feel cheap.This case provides more than double my iPhone 5\\'s battery life and I am able to use my phone for the entire day and still able to carry a full health iPhone around at night!If you have a screen protector installed than it will not hinder the install of the case. Other than that this is an absolute awesome case. I had the case charged in a few hours, used it and charged my Iphone up to 100% pretty fast. I can get at least 2 charges from one battery charge when my iPhone is at 40-50%. The volume and power buttons work well through the case, and the location of the charge indicator lights and power switch for battery on the bottom of the case work well. I got the matte black case and the finish of it is sleek. I like how it has a function button where you can turn the battery on and off. The phone is flush with the case itself which makes it fit perfectly in the case.\\nI ordered the Jackery Bar for a long trip around Europe, where I knew I\\'d find fewer wall sockets than I needed, especially on planes.  It did great.  I found the best use of it was to recharge my phone on the nightstand next to the bed, where no hotel I stayed at, or the river cruise boat, had a plug, but I could still reach the phone at night.  The unit easily fits in a pocket in my small messenger bag.  I saw some reviews about it heating up - I didn\\'t find that to be the case.  Some others didn\\'t like the color - I love the orange because I\\'m tired of not being able to find black items in a black bag; I\\'m about ready to wrap my glasses case in crime scene tape, for that very reason.  Another person griped about having to carry another cord; whatever.  But it\\'s the same cord I use to download pix from camera to computer, so it wasn\\'t extra for me.  It took about a half a day to charge it from a nearly discharged state, although I didn\\'t test it. Worth the 40 bucks, and more. UPDATE 2016 - After 6 years of nearly daily use, my Jackery Bar appears to have died.  I consider that to be outstanding performance!  I am ordering another one tonight, at a greatly reduced price - less than $15.\\nI bought this battery charger on the recommendation of a friend of mine. It\\'s a tiny little piece of equipment that does the job as well as look aesthetically pleasing. After a few days of usage, here are my thoughts:Pros:- The packaging it comes in is extremely minimal, with little in the way of extraneous materials. It comes with a felt-like clam shell carrying case that has a band that wraps around it to keep it closed.- It comes with a flat, durable microUSB cable that lets you connect to either a USB port (computer or AC adapter) to charge the battery, or connect it to whatever you want to charge.- There are two USB ports on the device: fast and slow charging, depending on whether or not you\\'re charging a tablet or phone. This comes in handy as I\\'ve severely damaged a phone\\'s battery by accidentally charging it with a tablet charger in the past.- It\\'s very small, as it shows in the product description. The green one I bought stands out easily amongst the black and grey chargers I have scattered throughout.- It charged to full in about 8 hours, so you can easily charge it overnight prior to, say, a business trip.- It charged my HTC DNA to full in about two hours, which is about the speed it would take to charge from its usual AC adapter.Cons:- The base is a little too rounded, so it wobbles a bit. Not a big deal.- The case\\'s finish is slick, so it\\'s a little harder to wipe off dust. Also not a big deal to me.With all of the portable battery options out there, the Moonstone 6000 stands out due to its unique design and thoughtful accessories. The first thing I usually notice when I enter my office is the charger! The carrying case is a nice touch, and the extra USB cable that can be easily rolled up is even nicer. I highly recommend this battery charger.\\nSince I\\'ve purchased this item (three weeks ago), I\\'ve demoed it for three colleagues. All three have gone on to purchase this same model of the Jackery. It\\'s a wonderful device, at a great price point. Here are the big selling points:- This Jackery holds enough charge to fully power an iPhone 3 times.- Charging an iPhone with the Jackery is just as fast as plugging into the wall (not so with other chargers I\\'ve used)- The Jackery is about the same size and weight as an old iPod mini. It\\'s not minuscule, but it\\'s not large. And it\\'s definitely not heavy. Given it\\'s function as a back-up, auxiliary battery, it fits nicely into your travel bag, where you can forget about it until you need it. And you can leave it there for a long time, because it holds an incredible amount of backup power.- The Jackery is plug agnostic. I\\'ve used it to power my old 30-plug iPad, my \\\\\\\\\"lightening\\\\\\\\\" connected iPhone, and my friends\\' android phone.  Jackery don\\'t care.  Jackery just works.That\\'s it. The \\\\\\\\\"flashlight\\\\\\\\\" functionality is a little bonus.  But this is a great workhorse.  I\\'ll close by saying this: in the past, I have found it difficult to remember to recharge my auxiliary battery after using it... and then find myself lugging around a dead battery. With the Jackery, you have three full charges before it\\'s dead weight... and three times to remind yourself to charge it back up again...Great, great product.\\nI\\'ve used several batteries in the past for other devices and I\\'ve never been so impressed.I took a chance on this set and after about a week I can tell you that I am extremely happy that I purchased this brand over the &#34;others&#34;, because I\\'ve gone through several cycles of charges now and they last just as long/perform just as well as the stock Samsung OEM battery.But the charger is what makes this really worth the money. You can charge a spare while you have one in your phone and it actually worksCharging the batteries is incredibly simple, and the light turns from red to blue to let you know when your battery has chargedYou really can\\'t beat these for the price.\\nI have been using a Goal Zero Guide 10 Plus Solar kit to keep our phones charged while traveling for my sons baseball games and family travels. It\\'s a good system, you can charge an iphone 4S with the battery pack or solar panel but it only charges one phone at a time. The battery pack gives you mobility but it only charges one iphone 4S and it’s dead. The solar panel will charge your device but only while you’re out in the sun. After our family trip to Italy I realized we needed something more.I heard Leo Laporte’s Tech Guy radio show on KFI am 640 in Los Angeles, thru iHeart Radio, talk about the Jackery battery packs with USB ports, that were good and reliable. I found them on Amazon in several different sizes. After Leo’s recommendation and reading the reviews I went with the Jackery Giant because of the two USB charging ports, battery capacity and the number of devices my family has. The ordering was painless and the delivery was quick. There is not much to it, just the battery pack and a USB cable for charging the unit with USB’s on both ends. You will need a wall wart to plug into an electrical outlet (find one that charges at 2.1 amps for the fastest charge).  The wall wart seems like such a no brainer, I don’t know why they don’t include it. On a side note, after hearing Leo Laporte talk about electrical outlets with USB charging ports built into them I bought one from Home Depot that has two USB charging outlets with a smart chip. I installed it in the kitchen where we charge most of our stuff, it works great and very convenient.I charged the unit and then charged my iphone. I was so disappointed when the charger died after one phone charge. I didn’t have time to get the unit replaced before we were to leave for the next baseball tournament so I plugged the unit in again and let it charge up one more time. I was very relieved to charge two iphone 4S at the same time from 20% to 100% and than an ipad from 35% to 100%. The unit has never had that problem again.We used our iphone maps to get around to all the different baseball games in Atlanta Georgia and it really drains your phone battery quick. The Jackery gave us freedom the from a wall or car outlet to enjoy the games and keep everyone at home up to date on the games progress. We loaned the Jackery to one of the team moms who’s phone went dead.In the Atlanta airport there were people everywhere plugged into any outlet they could find to charge their phones. My son and I charged our phones in our pockets in the airport and my wife charged her phone on the plane with the Jackery.The Jackery kept all our equipment charged without any problems and with extra juice to spare. My kids are still using it around the house when their batteries low and their moving from room to room.The unit is big, it’s about as long, a little wider and three times as thick as a iphone but it’s not bad. I put a large rubber band around it to keep it, my phone and cable togetherAnd now for an update, 7-17-15. I’ve been using my Jackery Giant for two years with no problem, well almost no problems. My problem early on was the thing was never charged when I needed it. My kids always had it plugged into their phone and forgot to charge it when they were done. My lectures and pleas fell on deaf ears so come Christmas time I knew what everyone was getting from me. I bought my wife and kids the smaller 5200 mAh Jackery. Problem solved, well mostly, I keep mine charged up and ready to go and my sneaky kids know it. They still use mine when theirs is dead. Oh Well.My Jackery Giant has been a real word warrior, it has received an incredible amount of abuse and still works. This thing has been dropped 6+ times from chest height in the dirt, asphalt and concrete. It survived a flight of 12+ feet to the asphalt when it flew out of a cooler I slung over my shoulder. Oh how the stomach drops when you hear something electronic hit the asphalt.The plastic on both ends are chip and broken. The plastic on button broke for good yesterday after a crash, so I pried it off. Now I use a pencil or something small to reach in and turn it on. The incredible thing is with all the abuse it still works like it did when it was new.~Tom Lewis~hear something electronic hit the asphalt.The plastic on both ends are chip and broken.

Click the button...start juicing.\\nMy galaxy S3 charging port broke and phone still was in great shape otherwise. I didn\\'t want to pay199.99 for a refurbished one, so I got this charger and it works great. Strongly recommend\\nI had ordered a battery from another company, it took one charge and that was it.... while shipping that one back I decided to order from a different company (this one) When the battery arrived I was a little disappointed to see it was identical to the one that I had sent back. It had the same wrapper, labels, tools... everything.... but my disappointment soon turned to satisfaction! Installation was a breeze and required very little tech know-how. Being the owner of an I.T. company I would feel confident in letting my mother replace the battery, it was that easy. This battery has now been through 5 complete charge/drain cycles and my phone is like brand new.On a side note, if you get a bad battery please understand that it happens.... power cells go bad. I have lost count of how many bad after the first charge batteries I have purchased over the years, from AAA up to really expensive laptop batteries. So please, consider that before you leave a negative review.  Before you install your new battery there is a little tip that helps out a lot, get your phone warm.... make a long phone call, surf the net, whatever it takes to get the phone warm (do not stick it in an oven, or leave it on the dash of your car) the goal is to get the battery you are taking out warm to soften the adhesive that holds it in, this makes removal a lot easier. After installing your new battery, plug it into the wall charger and let it do a complete charge to 100% then you are ready to go. Before you charge it again... run it completely dead (below 10%) then charge to 100% again. By doing this you &#34;condition&#34; the battery and will get more out of it... you will need to do this at least 4 times. You should, if possible, never &#34;top off&#34; charge any battery... rechargeable batteries are limited to &#34;cycles&#34; every time you charge it, that is a cycle.... enjoy your new battery, have a great day!\\nI\\'ve had this charger for about 5 days and it\\'s been awesome! By leaving it in my car and next to the window in my office I\\'ve been able to charge my phone fully every few days (it sits on the dash of my civic nicely on hour long car rides and doesn\\'t slide at all). Note: I live in an apartment surrounded by trees on all sides, so you might be able to get performance than I do. Even with indirect sunlight, the charger can still charge. In that respect, it\\'s quite impressive. Also, the device comes with the plugs that work for my GS3 and my mom\\'s iPhone 4, though I\\'ve pretty sure anyone will already have a USB charger for their phone anyway.My only issue with this is that the indicator lights that show how much power is being used are not very logical and the user manual is absolutely awful. I had to e-mail the company that sells this to get clarification, and to their credit they gave a great explanation and did so very quickly (within a half hour). Allow me to save you the hassle: There are a set of 4 LED lights. The first one turns red when it is getting enough sunlight for the device to store energy. All 4 lights turn blue when you plug it in to charge it through USB. The manual gave me the impression that the lights all turn red as it stockpiles a charge. That\\'s not the case (the manual doesn\\'t say what color the LED lights will be in this case). So, I sat there for the first few days wondering why only the first red light would come on. Why wasn\\'t it charging more? Well, only the blue lights indicate how much it is charged. So, to know how much energy the device has, you have to plug it in. That was a bit confusing for me and I wasted a day\\'s worth of charging by not knowing that. I could have gotten much better performance from this so far had I figured that out sooner.Overall, though I love this device. Sure, it saves a bit of money in electricity costs but the convenience in not needing electricity is much better. When I lived in Cincinnati a few years ago, most of the city lost electricity for days. If I had this with me, I could have saved myself (and my family who constantly tried to get in touch with me) a lot of headache.The real benefit to me, however is that since it\\'s barely bigger than my GS3, it\\'s easy to have my phone charging in my pocket or backpack without being tied to an outlet (though to many it will be slightly too thick to keep in your pocket with your phone). I go to a lot of conferences and events where I am e-mailing, tweeting, or taking notes on my phone. This device will let me go crazy with that and not have to worry about my phone dying. I also worry that one day my phone will die just before an emergency happens. That\\'s no longer a concern, either.This charger is easily worth the $40 I paid for it and worthy of a 5 star rating.UPDATE: 6/5/14I\\'ve had this for a while and this review needed an update. I still love it, but I should add a few notes. First, this charges very slowly. If I\\'m using my Samsung GS3 and it\\'s plugged into this charger, my battery will still lose power (but it will do so very slowly). So, you can\\'t plug in your phone when it\\'s at 2% and use it constantly and expect that this charger will help. It still charges and even though it\\'s slow, it\\'s still very useful. But some will find the slow charging annoying. Second, there are better options if you\\'re only looking for a charger that you\\'ll need for a short period of time (like going out for one night). My wife bought a charger that can only be charged from an electrical outlet. That charges faster and feels like it\\'s of much better quality. But, those kinds of chargers won\\'t do you much good if you\\'re out camping for a few days, since it will probably run out after charging your phone a few times.Overall, I still really like this device, though some people should look harder at the non-solar chargers. I kind of hate saying that because I love the idea of solar chargers, but it\\'s true.\\nSo far it works as described. Easy to charge and has all the adapters to charge my toys. The one really bad flaw is an on/off button that is raised above the case. This means it tends to get turned on accidentally in a briefcase or suitcase. Anyone that travels frequently knows that on/off switches need to be sunken in the case or protected by a raised bevel.UPDATE --->> I had to come back and give this device a fifth star, as much for the Customer Service as anything else. I have used it several times and it works great. In addition to that, the manufacturer has emailed me and Customer Service called me last night and offered to exchange this for the Anker 14400 which apparently has a more flush button. I declined because I really like the way this one charges but I was very impressed. They really seemed like they were not going to rest until I was completely satisfied. 5 stars for attitude!\\nMotorola places some minor obstacles, but replacing the battery in a Droid 4 can be done in less than five minutes IF you have the right tool.  Amazon sells [[ASIN:B0051LIRT4 T5 T6 Philips Slotted Screwdriver Opening Tool Set for Cell Phone]] for a reasonable price, if you don\\'t already have a T5 Torx screwdriver.  To release the back cover of the phone, so it\\'ll slide off, you\\'ll need to stick the end of a paper clip into the tiny hole in the upper right-corner of the phone\\'s back while sliding the back cover downward.  Set the cover aside.Once you remove the phone\\'s back cover, carefully peel the sticker off of the back of the battery and set it aside.  Holding the phone upright you\\'ll find a small, soft, black rectangular insulator at the bottom right end of the battery.  Carefully lift and remove the insulator with your fingernail, which will expose two tiny screws.  That\\'s where your T5 Torx screwdriver is needed.  Remove the two tiny screws and set them aside.In many Droid 4 phones the battery has been stuck in place with an elastic adhesive.  If your battery is stuck, carefully slide a thin plastic spudger between the battery and the phone, being very careful NOT to bend the battery.  Once you\\'ve broken the adhesive, the battery should easily lift out.  This new battery will fit into the exact same spot from which the old battery came.  A small dab of rubber cement on the back of the new battery will prevent it from rattling.  Then use the tiny screws to connect the new battery through its flex cable to the phone\\'s terminals, replace the black rectangular insulator and carefully re-apply the sticker.  Reattaching the phone\\'s back completes the job.  Your phone should be ready to return to service with a fresh, new battery.  This battery gave my wife\\'s Droid 4 new life.\\nThis package came to me one day earlier! As soon as I got it I charged it even though it was at 55%ish I still followed the instructions so I can get the best battery life I could have. The charge took about I\\'d like to say 3-4hours I\\'m not sure I think 3. Anyways when It hit 100% I unplugged it and went to work.Battery x-minutes: D=days| H=hours|M=minutes|S=seconds100%[Auto brightness on & GPS]97%-[After driving from work 23m & 21s]95%-[After a listening to some music and making a phone call 20m]83%-[Listening to music for 2h & 13m]76%-[Listening to music for 4h]62%-[Listening to music for 6h]51%-[Listening to music for 8h]49%-[After a text then in standby time for an 1h & 30m]43%-[After playing Real racing 3 for 20m]40%-[After surfing the web and going on youtube for 9m]27%-[After playing Call of duty,Texting,Surfing web,Checking mail,making a phone call and a little standby time for 3hr 7m]22%-[After standby time of just call and text for 7hrs.]16%-[After phone call and a text and surfing the web as well as taking a picture and listening to music for 2h]15%-[While watching youtube for 1m]10%-[While watching youtube for 1h]6%-[While having my flashlight on for 20m][So far at 3% the phone has lasted me for 23h & 43m]2%-[While on standby form 6% for 2-3hrs I think it was.][Lasted 1day 1hour 7minutes and 40seconds on hard useage all together.Then after at 1% I turned it off and fully charge took about 4-5 hours and then I started the test again but not exactly I didn\\'t keep track of it but It lasted a lot longer than before.The Battery comes with a custom back that I highly prefer than the one with samsung because it seems to me easier to hold the phone and also when you lay it on the backside and have music playing the speakers are up so you can still hear music as load as you would if was on its face side. The cameraIS NOT defected by this case I took many shots with and without flash in variety lighting locations. The back snap on is easy to put on but hard to take off. It to me though is less slippery than the samsung one they provide with the phone. I can easily make calls and text and do anything with this big thing in. The NFC DOES WORK I\\'ve tested it on 2 other samsung s4s and works great!Pros:-Long lasting power battery-Less slippery battery backing-no logo on back of battery case.-NFC works-Camera/Flash isn\\'t effected by the case.-Gives the ability to have the face on the backside and still have clear load audio.-Bigger for bigger hands but not too big just right.-Heavier if like the feel of knowing you\\'re holding something.Cons:-Heavier if drop it will most likely I\\'d think hurt the phone bad but I\\'m not 100% on this just thought.-Bigger if have small hands might make it hard for you to hold.-No cases support the hugeness of the battery.[Even case that they make with this will not help from a drop]OVERALL:It\\'s a must if a gamer or just enjoy amazing battery life and is very anti-to dropping the phone.\\nThis product is fantastic. I can get about 3/4 of a day on a battery with heavy use on my S4, so the spare is a huge help. Also a huge help when traveling and you don\\'t have access to an outlet. Makes long trips on the motorcycle great because I can fit the spare in my pocket.However, MAKE SURE you get this from a reputable seller. I ordered this, before Amazon had stock, from an overseas seller in Korea. It turned out to be counterfeit Samsung product. The packaging was completely different and there were no holographic stickers anywhere. When pulling the products out of the packaging, it was VERY hard to tell, but there are differences! The seller tried to tell me that the holographic sticker was not necessary in Korea by saying, \\\\\\\\\"Samsung Korea product does not have hologram recently. Package design is changed.\\\\\\\\\" This is NOT TRUE per Samsung!Make sure you order from Amazon themselves or another legitimate seller. (I have posted an image of the differences in the customer images section of this product listing.)EDIT: To all saying that this is a counterfeit product, or you are missing parts, you are buying from third-party sellers. Demand your refunds from Amazon (which they will do easily!) and wait for it to show \\\\\\\\\"Ships and sold from Amazon\\\\\\\\\" in the description. It is worth the wait to receive the correct OEM product.\\nThe Hyperion S4 extended battery is great!  I get nearly 3 days worth of heavy usage with it and now NFC works!The only thing missing was a case... and this solved it.  It\\'s not a fancy case by any means.  It\\'s your typical TPU case that\\'s flexible but not floppy (that\\'s what she said?).  There\\'s a small lip on the front so you can put your phone face down and the screen won\\'t touch the surface.  The good part of this phone is that it\\'s matte and textured so the phone is less likely to slip out of your hand.  The TPU case will provide minimal protection at best.Last thing, although the cut outs are generous, certain USB plugs (from Monoprice) won\\'t fit in without bending the case a little because the plug is too fat.\\nThe Maxboost Plus is the mother of all battery cases. The Plus is the only battery case that I have ever seen that carries 3,000mAh of potential of power. Every other battery case that I have come across that claimed to have this much power was either lying or simply huge. That\\'s why the Plus is such a great product. Not only is it truly 3,000mAh but it also is a great size. Of course there is a little difference between this and say, a mophie juice pack air but the extra size is well worth the power. Think about never having to worry about powering your iPhone for multiple days. Extended weekend? No problem.The Plus features a pretty standard two-piece system. Simply slide the iPhone 5 in and your good to go. One nice feature of the Maxboost Plus is the power switch which is located on the back of the case. No longer do you have to press and hold an ambiguous button, crossing your fingers that your \\\\\\\\\"doing it right\\\\\\\\\". Just switch the power toggle to the ON position (green) and the phone begins to charge. Maxboost also uses the 4-light LED power gauge indicator. Press the button on the back and you can see how much power is left in the case. The case is also equipped with an extra large aux port so you can plug most audio plugs into the case. If not, the case will come with an extension audio cable that you can use to fit the case. The Plus is a great buy for all the specs that you get. If you want a battery case that is guaranteed to last you all day at a great price, check out the Maxboost Plus. A new found favorite of mine.\\nIts an excellent small battery backup. But be aware, its 2600ma capacityis roughly the same as the battery in the large smart phones, so youwill get one full charge if your big smart phone battery is empty. Wellmade. Perfect battery to be charged by solar\\nI purchased this HTC One charger, so I wouldn\\'t wear down the micro-usb port, nor have to search in the dark to insert it. Additionally, it is very sturdy and holds my phone in the portrait position, with both speakers exposed and full screen accessibility. It charges quickly, using a micro-usb > usb cord, which plugs into a wall adapter. The phone can be used while charging.The dock/charger, comes with a small adapter which fits near the bottom; it can be removed to accommodate very thin cases or full-body skins. In fact, the HTC Flip (Red/Black Leather) with front cover, purchased with my phone, would fit fine into the charger, with the adapter removed. With the adapter in place, my HTC One fits securely without a case; and also fits fine with a total body skin cover.I am so impressed with the quality, versatility, and screen angle - I am tempted to buy a second charging dock to use as my car dock. It would sit well on my dash with a little velcro tape.I hope my review is helpful in your decision. Any questions, just ask!McGeezy\\nI use my S3 heavily and am lucky to get 5-6 hours on the OEM battery. I read the reviews and had high hopes that this product would rectify the problem. I followed the instructions to the T and began to use this battery, and was shocked that it regularly lasted over 12 hours for me. It definitely does what it is designed to do. The only bad thing is the cover is a bit flimsy, but after I developed a crack in mine, I contacted customer service and they shipped a replacement cover out to me free of charge. This product is awesome and so is the customer service. I must note that whoever is posting the zerolemon reviews under every other extended battery\\'s review page, I find that to be quite unethical and in bad taste as well. (It\\'s almost certainly from an employee of ZeroLemon as the reviewer is always anonymous and usually it is not an Amazon verified purchase). Real companies let the product and their own customers do the marketing, not their own employees posting reviews for their own product.\\nPull out your big-pockets and don\\'t expect something light, but this package provides plenty of power«««««««««««»»»»»»»»»»»The Praise (Good Things)«««««««««««»»»»»»»»»»» * Small form factor for the amount of battery content * Charge status and level indicator LEDs * Automatic power off * PowerIQ(tm) feature to automatically route power and line connectivity based on the device plugged in * Excellent value for cost««««««««««»»»»»»»»»»The Raze (Bad Things)««««««««««»»»»»»»»»» * Construction of the included cable is cheap«««««««««««««»»»»»»»»»»»»»The Haze (Things to Consider)«««««««««««««»»»»»»»»»»»»» * About the size of a 5\\\\\\\\\" smart phone but thicker * Substantially heavier than an average smart phone * Charges more slowly than the power it supplies * Will not charge low-power-draw devices due to Auto-Off function * Charging this device draws more power than some chargers can provide * Does not come with an AC power adapter to charge itself so charging off USB is a very long process»»»»»»»»»»»»»»The Details...REVIEWER\\'S NOTE:AnkerDirect has changed the product on this ASIN to a \\\\\\\\\"2nd Gen\\\\\\\\\" version. Many of the older reviews are reviews of the original first generation. This review has been updated to the second generation product currently provided here.Edit February 25 2015:Due to the increasing average size of smart phones, some terminology has been changed to better reflect the changing reality around the world.This battery comes in a comfortable packaging with good instructions and a few interesting items. A double-sided mini-booklet advises how to get in touch with support in case of issues and solicits reviews in case of happiness. A short Micro USB cable is included as well.Sadly, I have to touch on the raze item right here:The construction of the USB cable is continuing the Anker standard of low quality. The outside sheath that covers the Micro USB connector should be the proper place to grab to remove the connector from a device, however just like in the Anker car power adapter, this sheath is not connected securely and slides down the cable instead. This exposes the connector to additional stress as the protective cover is gone and getting the connector out without sliding that protective cover down requires pulling on the cable itself, which is not good for it.This is really secondary and overall not worth a star off, however Anker really should address this issue since it has now come up in two separate products that I have purchased from them.What I would honestly love to see is some way to have things plugged into this without the cable sticking out so far. Phone and Battery, back to back with a low-profile connection to each would be truly-portable charging.»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»Battery for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a late night snack...Nobody can deny that the digital world of today is a power-hungry place. Charging stations have cropped up all over and it\\'s not uncommon to see folks\\' phones plugged into the local wall sockets at coffee shops or bars or hotels. Phones and tablets are faster, brighter, and more powerful, but they eat batteries like mad. Even with an extended life battery clipped to the back or stuck inside, most people will find themselves running low at some point. That\\'s where an external charger battery comes into play.Let\\'s start with some numbers and quick facts:USB specification carries 5V (five volts). Officially, it carries 500mA (milliamps), or 0.5A. Running something at 500mA for one hour will consume 500mAh (milliamp-hours) of energy. Amps are a unit of DRAW - or \\\\\\\\\"pull\\\\\\\\\" - not \\\\\\\\\"push\\\\\\\\\". If a battery has 1,000 mAh of capacity, it can have a 500mA draw for two hours. With 10,000mAh of capacity, it can support the same draw for 20 hours. The mA or Amp rating of a power supply (3A in the case of this external battery) is how much load (pull... remember?) it can take without overloading. It will not \\\\\\\\\"push\\\\\\\\\" that much through and kill things, however it can have problems if the load placed on it exceeds its capacity. So basically, a battery can provide energy for hours equal to its capacity in mAh divided by the average draw in mA.Batteries are just a chemical reaction that makes electricity. More chemicals means more energy can be stored. But more chemicals also means a bigger battery and a heavier battery. Plus it\\'s important to consider that the Lithium-Polymer battery stores electricity at 3.7 volts, so there also has to be circuitry to change that up to 5V for the USB connector. More power takes more space and more weight. As a good example, the battery in an HTC One M7 is 2,400mAh, or a bit under 1/4th the capacity of this. Thus, this device will have a battery that is about four times the size and weight of the battery inside the HTC One. That also means this can potentially recharge an HTC One about four times. It\\'s important to realize that in reality, there is a moderate loss in power capacity due to conversion circuitry so it\\'s normal to expect about 80% or so of the pure math as a result. In my testing, I encountered about 96% of the raw math. Some of that is overhead and safety zone on the devices though.Got all that?»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»Just make it work FASTER!Both Apple and Android device makers (as well as others) realized that it takes a Long Time to charge a battery with only 500mA of input. So they made their devices capable of drawing more power, often 1.5A or more. They needed a way to know whether they were plugged in to a normal USB port that could only deal with 0.5A though, so they wouldn\\'t overload the port. So both developed circuit signalling that would allow a high-amp charger to identify itself so the device would use the higher current and charge faster. Both of these signalling methods are enabled on this external battery, which is a boon to quick-charging devices. The battery pack implements PowerIQ(tm) to automatically detect the charging type, rather than separate ports, which allows the charging of two Apple or two Android devices simultaneously.»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»Pocket-Sized Power - For decent pocketsThis is important to consider. This is thicker than a 5\\\\\\\\\" smart phone. Take the HTC One again as an example:5.4 x 2.7 x 0.4 inches &lt;- HTC One5.4 x 2.6 x 0.59 inches &lt;- Anker Gen 2The face of the battery pack is slightly smaller than the phone, but the pack is also slightly thicker. In my case, I wear cargo pants due to everything I need to carry for work. Not only do I have normal side pockets big enough to completely hold a 7\\\\\\\\\" tablet, but I also have cargo pockets. Having effectively \\\\\\\\\"another phone\\\\\\\\\" in size and about two or three phones in weight is no big issue for me. If you have a very small handbag or wear tight pants with tiny pockets, this may not really be \\\\\\\\\"pocket sized\\\\\\\\\" for you.  At the same time, this is the most-compact power supply I have found so far, with the amount of power it holds being very good for its size. It\\'s easy to find others that are just as big or even bigger yet hold substantially-less juice. It\\'s also easy to find others of the same price or more expensive that can\\'t hold as much juice either. So in both Power/Size and Power/Cost, this is a winner.»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»Features that matterThe Charge Level Indicator LEDs will tell you how it\\'s doing both when charging this battery as well as when using this battery to charge other things. The simple push-button operation makes it easy to turn on and it will turn itself off when the current draw is too low. Nothing connected? It turns itself off. So you can check its battery level with a push and see if you need to recharge it before heading out. Many phones also draw less than this when they are fully charged and asleep, so again, auto-off.However it\\'s important to note that minimum draw. Some things like Bluetooth headsets and other devices draw very little current when charging. Try to plug in a tiny little on-the-ear headset and charge it and you might be in for a surprise as it doesn\\'t draw enough power to keep the battery pack on.»»»»»»»»»Feed Me!A thing to consider is that the battery itself draws 2 amps when charging. Remember: It doesn\\'t come with a power supply unit. Plug it in to your average computer USB at 500mA or a charger that can\\'t provide enough juice and suddenly... Doom. There is a chance for overloading the supplying source, which can cause it to heat up substantially. Voltage can drop on the supply, causing the external battery pack to not charge at all. And in the even that the battery pack recognizes that it can\\'t get enough current, remember how long we discussed it would take to charge the 10,000mAh battery at 500mA? Yup. 20 hours. More, actually, since there is conversion loss in the charging circuits.Oh, hey, look! There are reviews that talk about charging it for four hours and not getting past one LED lit and the wall charger heating up. So there are precisely the symptoms of charging on a normal computer USB or with something like a 1A wall charger.»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»It died for SCIENCE!Several things combined with other reviews create one chilling consideration: Numerous people appear to have discovered that the discharge protection on battery packs can be defeated by a highly-intent person.\\\\\\\\\"But what does THAT mean?\\\\\\\\\" you ask? Time for more science:Lithium-Anything batteries (Lithium-Polymer in this, Lithium-Ion, etc) must -NEVER- be 100% discharged. Due to this fact, devices (cell phones, media players, iPads, and other things that use Li-Ion batteries) will \\\\\\\\\"lie\\\\\\\\\" about the discharge status and consider the battery to be 0%, or \\\\\\\\\"Completely dead\\\\\\\\\", when it still has about 10% capacity remaining.  This is why even when the device says \\\\\\\\\"Dead!  No more!\\\\\\\\\" it can still turn on its screen using that \\\\\\\\\"dead\\\\\\\\\" battery for just a second to show you there is no more.The batteries don\\'t explode if they are discharged too low, or swell up (swelling happens from being overcharged and the charging circuit not going to float voltage), or release toxic gasses. They just Stop Working. Completely. If they are fully-discharged, whether by draw or by age, they will never, ever, EVER hold even an inkling of a charge ever again.The various reviews that indicate that it would never recharge are likely just people who plugged it into underpowered power sources for insufficient time, however the very nature of this kind of system means that people will Do Not-Good Things. Trying to squeeze the last tiny bit of power out of this battery... fully discharging it and then desperately trying to get it to turn on just for those last few moments... The result: Dead battery pack forevermore.»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»Summary - In the end, I hold the power.««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««Though it is not perfect and does have room for improvement, this is a very solid device.

Try to plug in a tiny little on-the-ear headset and charge it and you might be in for a surprise as it doesn\\'t draw enough power to keep the battery pack on.    »»»»»»»»»  Feed Me!    A thing to consider is that the battery itself draws 2 amps when charging. Remember: It doesn\\'t come with a power supply unit. Plug it in to your average computer USB at 500mA or a charger that can\\'t provide enough juice and suddenly... Doom. There is a chance for overloading the supplying source, which can cause it to heat up substantially. Voltage can drop on the supply, causing the external battery pack to not charge at all. And in the even that the battery pack recognizes that it can\\'t get enough current, remember how long we discussed it would take to charge the 10,000mAh battery at 500mA? Yup. 20 hours. More, actually, since there is conversion loss in the charging circuits.    Oh, hey, look! There are reviews that talk about charging it for four hours and not getting past one LED lit and the wall charger heating up. So there are precisely the symptoms of charging on a normal computer USB or with something like a 1A wall charger.    »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»  It died for SCIENCE!    Several things combined with other reviews create one chilling consideration: Numerous people appear to have discovered that the discharge protection on battery packs can be defeated by a highly-intent person.    \\\\\\\\\"But what does THAT mean?\\\\\\\\\" you ask? Time for more science:    Lithium-Anything batteries (Lithium-Polymer in this, Lithium-Ion, etc) must -NEVER- be 100% discharged. Due to this fact, devices (cell phones, media players, iPads, and otherthings that use Li-Ion batteries) will \\\\\\\\\"lie\\\\\\\\\" about the discharge status and consider the battery to be 0%, or \\\\\\\\\"Completely dead\\\\\\\\\", when it still has about 10% capacity remaining.  This is why even when the device says \\\\\\\\\"Dead!  No more!\\\\\\\\\" it can still turn on its screen using that \\\\\\\\\"dead\\\\\\\\\" battery for just a second to show you there is no more.    The batteries don\\'t explode if they are discharged too low, or swell up (swelling happens from being overcharged and the charging circuit not going to float voltage), or release toxic gasses. They just Stop Working. Completely. If they are fully-discharged, whether by draw or by age, they will never, ever, EVER hold even an inkling of a charge ever again.    The various reviews that indicate that it would never recharge are likely just people who plugged it into underpowered power sources for insufficient time, however the very nature of this kind of system means that people will Do Not-Good Things. Trying to squeeze the last tiny bit of power out of this battery... fully discharging it and then desperately trying to get it to turn on just for those last few moments... The result: Dead battery pack forevermore.    »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»  Summary - In the end, I hold the power.  ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««««    Though it is not perfect and does have room for improvement, this is a very solid device.

Will update if things go south, but I\\'m not expecting that it will.Here are my observations so far:1.) Great battery life.  Charged my Samsung G3 from 20% twice AND ran a USB fan all night on 1 charge with plenty left.2.) Left it unplugged for several days and didn\\'t notice any \\\\\\\\\"fast acting\\\\\\\\\" self-discharge.  Will it sit on a shelf for a month?  Who knows.3.) LOVE the micro USB cable.  Almost everything I own is micro so I\\'ve got tons of those, plus I can charge the Photive via the cable, unplug it and then charge my phone with the same cable.  I haven\\'t accidentally plugged it into itself and don\\'t plan to.  Hopefully it wouldn\\'t melt down.4.) Charging temp is cool, powering temp is cool.  Again, a good sign.  Charge time for my phone was longer than wall-plug charging, but not terrible.5.) The 4 battery life led\\'s are bright.  Have to cover them at night, but they are also VERY clear and indicate instantly how much power is left.6.) Pack feels well built and solid.  No rattle or shake, and seems very compact.  I haven\\'t chucked it at the wall (obviously) but based on experience would NOT expect it have issues if dropped occasionally.7.) Shuts off when nothing is plugged in.  Powers on when something is.Cons?a.) the POWER button doesn\\'t really do anything but show you battery status when nothing is plugged in.  Holding it down and pushing when something IS plugged in doesn\\'t shut off power.  Maybe it should be labeled \\\\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\\\" instead?b.) Bright LED\\'s at night?  Pretty standard brightness and honestly unless I didn\\'t want ANY lights, this really isn\\'t a valid complaint.  A bit of white tape if it bugs you or steal a smiley sticker from a kid.  :-)c.) . . . I\\'m out. . . that\\'s all I haveIt\\'s a great device for a great price.  Hopefully it lasts for a long time and 3 years from now I\\'m wishing I had bought more than 1.------Update:  I\\'ve now owned this little beauty for over 5 months, and it has traveled to Ecuador and back with me.  Since it has set for a few months on my nightstand and I can confirm that it holds a charge and doesn\\'t have any self drain that I can detect which is awesome for not KILLING THE BATTERY.  Everyone probably already knows this, the fastest way to kill a battery is to let it sit at 0 volts (dead) for a while which is what over time eventually does when not being actively used.This was a life saver on the plane.  I watched 2 movies on the my phone while plugged in (keeping my phone at 100%), then charged my brothers tablet (back to 50%), then charged my sisters phone (back to 60%).  Even then, there was still a bit left for me on the bus to the hotel.Basically, I still love it.--------------Another update.  lol.Owned this for over a year now.  It was sitting on my nightstand for another chunk of time, unused.  Picked it up and still had charge, but I charged it up to full and went on a 10 hour road trip.Since I listen to music with my phone (Samsung S3) and the cigarette lighter adapter causes hum, I used this guy to keep my phone up and running.  About 5 hours in, my wife\\'s phone was toast from playing games, so I swapped out the cable since mine was still at 100%.  About that time, one of the kid\\'s Nabi tables died, so we plugged it in too for a couple of hours.  During the last hour, I unplugged everything else and put my other kiddos tabled and there was still juice!Seriously, what more could you as ask for?  4 devices on a 10 hour trip kept up and running during consistent usage.\\nI received this charger on time, and it was charged when I received it.  Have used it severa times to charge my Droid and it does a good job.  I have charged the charger both from the outlet and using the solar panels, both seem to work fine. You do not have to leave this charger outside in the sun for it to charge - I was able to leave it on the kitchen window sill and the red light came on, indicating the solar panels were charging.  6000 mAh is a good size to be able to charge my phone multiple times if I ever need to.  I am planning on leaving this in the car \\\\\\\\\"just in case\\\\\\\\\", knowing I will always be able to charge my cell phone.\\nPlease read update.Fails when you need it most.  As another reviewer stated, the battery can crash and the only way to get it to work again is to plug it in.  Well the reason you\\'re probably buying it is bc you can\\'t plug your phone in at that moment.  Therefore, epic fail.Edit:Power Innovations were very easy to work with and they replaced my unit right away, as it was clearly defective.  The new one works without a hitch and I couldn\\'t be more impressed.  I can charge my iPhone 5 somewhere around 5-6 times on a single charge.  Power Innovations gets 5 stars and the product, now that it works, gets 5 stars.If you decide to go with this unit, be patient and know you may not get one that works correctly the first time.\\nI used to have a Boost Case for my iphone 4 that i really liked. I have since bought an iphone 5 and have been waiting for this battery case to come out. I read about all the others on Amazon: they either did not have enough juice or did not offer full case protection. This Lenmar case has both. I have tested the case and the iphone battery together I got 19 hours of usage and about 2-2.5 days between charging the case and the iphone. I usually get 8-9 hours of usage and 1 day between charges for the iphone alone. These numbers are as advertised: twice as much as you get from the iphone battery alone. On top of that the case charges the phone super fast.The fit of the case is really good; the materials are top rate. The gap in the seams are almost even everywhere. The top of the case fits snuggly with a nice click on the bottom part of the case even without the phone in the case.The only downside is that the phone becomes a tad bulky, but you have to expect that when you have a 2300 mah battery in the case.\\nSo this is my second Hyperion extended battery.. I had one on my Galaxy Nexus as well... But the with the Nexus, Hyperion also sold a case that would fit around its extended battery and battery cover... Although, it was a slightly low quality case, at least it existed!The battery itself performs really well, just as I\\'d expect from a 5200mAh battery... I was able to achieve 24 hours of average use (with nighttime standby) and still have 30% life at the end of the 2nd day.But where the heck is the Hyperion Case?? I am left with an unprotected phone because no case is avaialable to fit this phone with the extended battery installed... I emailed Hyperion and was told \\\\\\\\\"something was in the work\\\\\\\\\", but no solid ETA for such a solution. That\\'s a no-go. I am considering taking the extended battery off just so that I can put a regular case on while I wait for Hyperion to make a case. Therefore, 4 stars until I can use this product without fear of scratching up my unprotected phone.UPDATE: Changed to 5 stars, the case is now available!\\n[Updated 6-16-13 - Newest info at the start of the article.  Older review included below for reference.]Battery life is great, warranty and service are great, price is great.  My only problem with this battery was that the NFC originally didn\\'t work.  Anker has now revised this battery four times and this final design is indeed working like the stock battery.  It reads all the test tags that I have put in front of it (with the notable omission of TecTiles2 which I haven\\'t tested because I don\\'t have any) and it works with a Galaxy S3 in touch-to-beam mode.The only difference I could see was that the Mifare Ulralight MiniBlock was detected in just one corner of the Anker battery where the stock battery seemed to pick it up when it was placed anywhere on the battery, but I think that\\'s really nit-picking.Also, these batteries are slightly thicker than my stock battery (by the thickness of 2-3 pieces of paper) but as others have said, after they have been in the phone for a couple of days they seem to get thinner so perhaps the stock battery was thicker to start with as well.  In any case, they don\\'t come close to interfering with the back and there is no visible bulge, even on close inspection, so I see this as a non-issue too.I\\'m updating my rating to 5 stars.  Great work Anker!  -darren[Original Review - 3 stars]I purchased two of these and had the same results out of each.  The battery is very good and seems to power the phone as well as the stock battery.  The NFC, however, doesn\\'t work.  I have six different NFC tags of various types that I tested the Anker batteries with.  The stock battery recognizes all of them while the Anker batteries didn\\'t recognize a one -- not so much as a blip to acknowledge the presence of the tags.  Next I tested them with a powered NFC device (a Galaxy S3 with original Samsung battery) and the presence of the other phone is detected by the Anker batteries but theconnection immediately disappears and transfer is not possible.  Again, it worked fine when I put the stock battery back in the S4.Anker makes good products and they stand behind them.  In this case Amazon asked me to send the batteries back directly to Amazon for inspection since they were the fulfillment house.  Hopefully they can bring it to the attention of Anker and they can get this problem resolved.  In the meantime, it\\'s a great battery if you don\\'t need NFC.[5-10-13 Update]Less than an hour after posting my review, someone from Anker contacted me to apologize for the NFC problems.  They are sending out replacement batteries for me to test further.  I\\'ll report back on my findings.  As always, fantastic warranty support![5-20-13 Update]As promised, Anker sent me two replacement batteries which arrived just a few days later.  They were new and packaged just as the first two were.  Unfortunately I had virtually the same results this time around.  Both Anker batteries performed identically.  Below are the results of my tests with various NFC tags, comparing the results obtained with the stock battery and the Anker batteries.Mifare Ultralight (SMARTRAC MiniBlock Mifare Ultralight) - OEM: Reads OK; Anker: Not detectedMifare Ultralight X (Disney Keycard) - OEM: Reads OK; Anker: Not detectedMifare Classic 1K (UPM RAFLATAC RaceTrack) - OEM: \\\\\\\\\"This tag is not supported\\\\\\\\\"; Anker: Not detectedMifare Classic 1K (UPM RAFLATAC Round) - OEM: \\\\\\\\\"This tag is not supported\\\\\\\\\"; Anker: \\\\\\\\\"This tag is not supported\\\\\\\\\"Mifare Classic 1K (Samsung Door Key) - OEM: \\\\\\\\\"This tag is not supported\\\\\\\\\"; Anker: \\\\\\\\\"This tag is not supported\\\\\\\\\"NOTE: The Galaxy S4 doesn\\'t read MIFARE Classic tags which were compatible with the Galaxy S3 because of a change in chipset.  The \\\\\\\\\"This tag is not supported\\\\\\\\\" prompt is the appropriate behavior for the Galaxy S4.I also put the S4 back-to-back with a Galaxy S3 with stock battery to see if I could transfer a website using Android Beam.  With the OEM battery I was able to touch to beam on every try.  With the Anker battery I was prompted to \\\\\\\\\"touch to beam\\\\\\\\\" but the screen either froze or went away.  I was never able to transfer a webpage.I wish I had better news.  There is clearly a coil in the battery but after trying four separate batteries from two sources, I think it\\'s fair to say that the battery is not a suitable replacement for the OEM battery unless you don\\'t need NFC.[5-23-13 Update - Mostly working - 4 stars]Anker sent me two new batteries to test.  I was told that these were an updated model of the product and indeed they were packaged *slightly* differently.  The packaging for batteries in the first two sets had a sticker on the box reading \\\\\\\\\"70SMGLXS4-S1W26NA.\\\\\\\\\"  The new packages have a larger sticker that adds \\\\\\\\\"X000FTB6EL\\\\\\\\\" and a barcode.  Inside the box, the batteries were wrapped in a slip-in plastic pouch whereas the earlier batteries were in heat-shrunk plastic that had to be cut to allow removal of the batteries.I repeated the same tests listed in my last update.  Both new batteries behaved identically.  In the newer test, the Anker batteries detected all three Mifare Classic tags (including the RaceTrack tags that the last batch ignored).  Unfortunately, they did not detect either of the other two tags.  On the surface that\\'s not much help because the only tags that the battery can sense are ones that the phone will not read!HOWEVER, in my test with a live phone, I was able to transfer a website link between the S4 with an Anker battery and another Samsung NFC-equipped phone.  I repeated this test in the other direction, repeated the tests several times and with both new Anker batteries.  The connection was solid and worked in all cases.  I didn\\'t get any of the drop-outs and failures that plagued previous Anker batteries.Since most users will be concerned with Android beaming rather than reading tags, I expect that this solution will work for a majority of users.  It is also possible that the Anker batteries will work with the newer Samsung TecTile2s, although since they just started shipping I don\\'t have any to run a test with.As always, Anker\\'s support department has been a pleasure to work with throughout.  If you have any concerns, rest assured that between Amazon and Anker, you won\\'t get stuck holding a dud.\\nIt just works. It has a micro-usb port in it that you plug into any micro-usb charger to charge it. then it also has a regular USB port that you use to plug your phone/ipod/kindle/psvita or anything that can charge using a regular USB port and it is just like it plugged into a regular wall charger.The 1000mAh output means that it should take roughly the same amount of time to charge your device as it would take when it is plugged into the wall, and the 2600mA capacity should be enough capacity to be able to fully charge your device at least one time (just divide 2600 by your battery capacity and that is how many times you can fully recharge your battery from this battery without having to recharge this battery - for my droid3 battery is 1500mA capacity, so I can recharge it fully 2600/1500=1.73 times, my ipod4g battery capacity is 930mA so I can recharge it 2600/930=2.8 times).It is small enough to keep in my jacket pocket, it probably weights similar to a small handful of coins. I only wish there was a way for me to be able to see how much juice was left in the battery so if I don\\'t use it for a long time I know that it is still fully charged, but for this price I doubt that would be possible - I know the large more expensive ones have that feature but those look to big and heavy for me to keep in my jacket pocket.Overall, for this price it is a no-brainer for everyone to just keep one fully charged in their jacket or bag for those times that your device is dead and you need to use it but can\\'t plug it in to the wall, or you don\\'t want to be tethered to wall. I will never have to look for an outlet again in a restaurant, airport, starbucks, friends house, etc.\\nAfter owning the 7000mAh gs3 version I knew that getting this battery for my note 2 was a complete must! Like other reviewers have said it does add weight and thickness to your note 2 .If that is something you cant deal with then I dont recommend this for you. Now if you are a tech junkie or simply someone who loves being able to enjoy  social networking music, and movies for hours with out having to be stuck on the charger and you can deal with the extra weight and thickness that this adds then buy this before this sells out again!! Now to get down to the pros and cons!!PROS:Comfortable Black TPU case not slippery doesnt feel like it will just slip out of your hand.And the obvious reason your reading this the battery life!! Now heres the truth and whether or not people agree the battery can last a week if your minimal user who only texts a few messages a day and is on the web for short periods of time now if your like me someone who loves the 5.5inch screen on full bright and does some a decent amount of texting (few hundred give or take )& enjoys refreshing social apps and watching videos then from my experience it can last you 2 days maybe 3 with a possible of 10 to 16 hours of screen time (maybe more this all depends on your brightness and other factors that i will mention below). Now this means the screen has been on for that amount of hours I did not install any custom Roms or do any thing special because I love simply enjoying what this battery can do my main goal was being able to go through a full day of use with out touching the charger period. And remember theres so much that can contribute to your battery life like the use of bluetooth, WiFi, jumping from 4G to 3G ect.ConsFor me noneI can still handle texting, calling, and web browsing with one hand.Others may find it a bit more difficult to use, so both hands will have to do.And yes no NFC not a deal breaker for me I have my oem battery if I ever need to use it .So with that said I hope you have a good experience.And im just a customer who is satisfied with this battery Giving credit where credit is due.If you have any questions I will do my best to address them from my own experiences.ADDED SIDE NOTE 5/6/13I forgot to mention that after owning both of theses batteries for the GS3 and the Note2 its important to kill the battery and recharge those first cycles (all this is written in a fold out that comes with the battery but a must to truly get every bit out of this monster battery)5/9/13I UPLOADED 2 SCREEN SHOTS OF MY PHONE TOTAL USAGE BEFORE I SET IT ON THE CHARGER WITH 16 HOURS SCREEN TIME OF FULL USE ON MAX BRIGHTNESS NO POWER SAVING MODE NOTHING BUT STOCK 4.1.2 SPRINT ROM FLASHED TO METRO PCS RUNNING ON 3G ( YES I KNOW HOW CAN I RUN SUCH A BEAST ON 3G WELL THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FLASH A PHONE) ANY WAYS FEEL FREE TO LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE BATTERY LIFE.

Perfect fit (over the GG-provided back cover), excellent grip and looks great!  Previously purchased a so-so case from GG directly [[ASIN:B00CJ0RMSC Gorilla Gadgets Slim Fit Flexible TPU Protective Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 SIII Extended Battery (Black)]], as I knew it would fit, but didn\\'t think about other options from different vendors, for fear the cases would not fit. The GG case did fit well, but provided very little grip and thin edge protection. I really like the two-layer protection this Laza case provides, which also adds a stylish color contrast. Yes the battery and case make the phone thick, but it looks great and the battery lasts a whole day.

When it arrived, I immediately threw it on the charger to give it a full charge.  My old battery provided about a day and a half of charge before dying.  It required a daily charge to ensure it always had enough power.  I received this new battery on Friday and it\\'s now Tuesday and I\\'m still on the same charge with 21% power remaining on the battery.  It\\'s been almost four days and I still have plenty of power left.  I\\'m really impressed and very happy!The battery comes with a back cover that isn\\'t a perfect match in color, but it\\'s close enough.  Its glossy finish matches well.  Even though it\\'s a little darker than the phone I have now, it provides a two-tone gray look with the stock phone that is actually quite nice.  The cutouts for the rear camera, flash, and speaker are perfectly aligned and provide a pretty noticeable recess for these items that protects them from getting incidental contact with anything when the phone is placed on its back.The thickness of the phone is about doubled with this battery and case.  For me, I like that.  It\\'s a beefier feel than the stock phone.  I have large hands and the stock phone is a little too thin for my liking.  I like to have a bit of weight and thickness.  It fits in my hand well and gives me more to hold onto.  The weight of the phone is also noticeably increased.  For my wife, she doesn\\'t like the thickness and weight, but I do.If you have a belt holster for your phone, the larger battery and new back will increase the thickness of your phone to be a little over 1/2\\\\\\\\\".  It just makes it in my belt holster.  You\\'ll want to ensure your current case/holster will accommodate the new phone thickness; otherwise you might want to consider a replacement case/holster.Overall, I\\'m really impressed.  If you\\'re like me and blow through your stock battery in about a day, this battery and case back combo is an excellent upgrade at a very reasonable price.  Highly recommended!EDIT 5/15/13: I\\'ve discovered something interesting about this battery.  I find, if I charge the battery with the phone running, I get a much lower charge than if I charge it with the phone off.  Originally, I was getting three to four days from this battery with moderate phone use.  When I charge it with the phone running, this reduces to about two days.  If I turn off the phone and charge it, I get about three to four days of charge.  I noticed some other reviews have reported their battery drops rapidly after charging.  I\\'ve noticed this too.  If you buy this battery, you might find the same thing.  If you do, try charging the battery with the phone powered down.  I\\'m not sure why this is occurring.  Contacting the vendor and requesting a replacement battery is also an option.  This option is one I haven\\'t ruled out.EDIT 5/21/13: Amazon has approved a refund and return of the battery and cover, but I\\'ve learned there\\'s actually nothing wrong with the battery.  The battery (as indicated in the instructions I forgot to read!) requires a minimum of twelve hours to charge.  When you place the phone on the charger, it will say it is 100% charged in only a few hours.  Don\\'t believe it!  If you take it off the charger early, it will lose charge quickly.  I placed the phone on the charger and let it charge for a full twelve hours and it\\'s working fine; it holds a charge for three to four days, based on my typical use.  So, lesson learned . . . If you buy this battery, BE SURE to provide a full twelve hours to properly charge the battery.EDIT 6/19/13: There appears to be abreak-in period for this battery.  I haven\\'t returned it and have chosen to keep it.  After a few weeks, I noticed the battery is now charging much faster.

I have noticed it still reports \\\\\\\\\"100%\\\\\\\\\" charge rather quickly, but doesn\\'t drop off so dramatically if I pull it off soon after it reports this.  Before, when I purchased the battery, if I took it off at 100%, it would drop charge 50% in a day.  Now it drops maybe 15% to 25% in a day, depending on use.

I\\'m not sure why it\\'s suddenly failing, but I think about fifteen months is all I was able to get out of this battery.

So i took a shot in the dark when i  purchased this one.no need to worry guys...this case is a definite win!!  it has a rubber innner layer and a hard outer  layer. fits snug and pefect!!! installation takes 30 seconds. It feels like quality and is a definite step up from the 7.99 tpu case.  spend the extra couple of dollars and get this case!!!UPDATE: i also ordered the seidio extended case.... it came in today. And i have come to the conclusion that the laza case is more stronger and sturdy(yet slightly bulky).the seidio case is decent but it has lots of rubber all around the sides rather as oppose to the laza case which has more hard plastic than rubber.the seidio case is about 25-30 dollars average. then you have to buy a compatible battery door for an additional 14.99.SO TRUST ME WHEN I SAy....You wont need the sedio if you get the laza case.  IN THIS SITUATION.....CHEAPER IS BETTER. and this is coming from somebody that has both!! Good luck guys\\nFits perfectly, and comes with a nice TPU case. It does make the phone a fair bit thicker and heavier. However, the thickness is about the same as any extended battery, and this one has more capacity than any other battery I\\'ve ever seen. Testing in the phone, I got about 3x life over my stock battery, as advertised. Testing on a standalone tester gave me 9347mAh. Highly recommended. If only other battery makers were honest about the capacity like ZeroLemon. This is the first extended battery I have tested that came out at the rated capacity.I will post again if it ages poorly, but so far it\\'s well worth the price.\\nIf there was NFC, this battery would rule them all. Arggh... it takes forever to charge, you have to kind of have to jam it into the back of the Note II- and it makes the phone an absolute brick.I\\'m a tech junkie, and thought that the lack of NFC was a deal breaker, but, this battery feels endless. I\\'m definitely a power user, and carry an extra Hyperion battery with me sometimes. Bluetooth music streaming, while net surfing and reading ebooks- that\\'s what I put my Note II through all the time. I play music through the AUX port in my car system whenever I\\'m driving around. Then my phone is an MP3 player, gps and all around entertainment system when I\\'m shopping. I read ebooks when I\\'m in line, I\\'ll watch a movie that I downloaded to my SD Card when I\\'m at the DMV or waiting for my car to be fixed at the shop. I almost always have this Note II in my hand.I live in Philly and sometimes take day trips to NYC. I was looking for a battery solution that will last no matter how long I am away from a charger. It\\'s not fun to be stuck in another city with a dead cell phone. It\\'s always better to have and not need, than need and not have. That\\'s my philosophy. This looks like it will do the job.This will not be my everyday battery, I have three smaller ones (2 Hyperion + 1 stock), but, this will be a back up for long long days. Shipping was fast, although you should expect to spend the first day just charging the battery.If you want endless power, this looks like the ticket. It\\'s relatively cheap, but pretty heavy. I\\'ll give an update once I power use it for an entire weekend.I don\\'t want to be- but I\\'m in. I like it, and don\\'t really need NFC for $50 more. Good job on this.-- Update--So this is becoming my every day case. you can do NFC tricks with Wifi and bluetooth settings in NFC Task Launcher. Having power that doesn\\'t budge pretty much all day is getting addicting. I did notice some lag issues and funky things after changing to this new setup. The issues aren\\'t terrible- I\\'m actually nervous about switching back to regular batteries, this thing has quickly skewed my perception of how long my Note II can last.It\\'s not for everyone- smaller people may have a problem with the size, but, when you\\'re holding it, the phone is thicker by feels really manageable somehow. Weird.Very pleasantly surprised.-- Another update---I tried to kill this battery, and will upload a screen shot. I\\'ll probably get about 40 hours of power on one full charge. This includes heavy bluetooth streaming, netflix watching and other power hungry activities. Like everyone else says, this is the only battery you\\'ll ever need. Insane.----4.29.13 Update---I\\'m looking forward to case with a kickstand and otterbox type protection. This battery is 5+ star product. That\\'s why it\\'s selling out as soon as ZeroLemon stocks Amazon\\'s warehouses with the product. I\\'ll use the stock battery for-- I have no idea, maybe when I\\'m doing the Couch 2 5K app run in the mornings since this won\\'t fit in my armband as is. I don\\'t see any other reason to swap out this battery- it makes me want to use my phone even more often now. I\\'ll plug headphones in while using my laptop just because I can or watch a show on hulu plus in bed instead of on the couch. Just like the Note II is not for everyone (ie., I-people who are nervous about too much confusing technology), this battery is not for everyone. But as you can see by the reviews, the people who want perpetual juice are in love with this product. I\\'m one of them.---11.12.13 Update--- An ultra-rugged case has come out for the Note II Zerolemon battery combo. I purchased it a couple days ago and will report back on how it performs. I think this battery is the single best accessory purchase I\\'ve made for the Note II. Nothing comes close for me. Months later and I usually end up around 60%battery after two day\\'s use. It\\'s unreal.battery after two day\\'s use. It\\'s unreal.\\nThis is my second purchase of phone replacement batteries that I have bought through Amazon under the Anker label, first for my Motorola Atrix and now for my new Samsung phone.  They fit perfectly, and both sets of batteries are of a higher mAh rating than the factory original, and the operational time exceeds the original batteries.  Moreover, when I didn\\'t leave a review on the first batteries, the Anker customer service contacted me to see if I was not satisfied.  When I described a problem I had with the free charger, they promptly dispatched me a new one.  I believe this company is a good one to deal with, and their batteries cost up to one half of what you would pay for a factory replacement from the manufacturers such as Motorola and Samsung.\\nThis is one of the best portable charger/battery that I have tried over the years. The 5V and full 1Amp of this unit charged a iPhone 5 from less than 20% to full in less than two hours and there is plenty more power left to fully charge other devices (1 mifi devices and a Galaxy) over the next couple of days.It is lightweight and slim. Think of it as a longer version of the standard iPhone charge block (about the length of 2 AA batteries).\\nIn 8 months of heavy use, I noticed my Samsung Galaxy S3 didn\\'t seem to keep the same charge.  I purchased one of these and then tested both batteries using Nova Battery Tester.  Here are the results:8 month old Samsung OEM 2100mAh battery:  1549mAhNew Anker 2200mAh battery with NFC:  2254mAhConsequently my effective battery life went up over 30% by switching.  I\\'ve come across generic batteries that don\\'t deliver on their rated capacities so I was very happy to see that this battery exceeds their rated specs.\\nWhen I bought this Astro3E external battery, I was looking basically for two things:1. High capacity, and2. A way to quickly charge my [[ASIN:B007W63WLO Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\\\\\\\\"]].I think I found both things in this Astro3E.The Astro3E has a battery level indicator, in the form of four lights on the front.  You press the middle button, and the number of lights that light up correspond to the charge level.  You charge the battery by using a micro-USB to USB cable, and plug the USB cable into a USB-AC adapter (or into a charging port on your computer, but this is a much slower way of charging generally speaking).  The lights on the Astro3E blink when the battery is charging, to indicate the charge status, and the lights go out completely when the battery is full.To charge devices with the battery, plug the device into one of the USB ports on the bottom of the battery, then press the middle button to begin charging.  The two ports are labeled \\\\\\\\\"Apple\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Android\\\\\\\\\" respectively.  I don\\'t have any Apple devices, so I haven\\'t actually been able to find any difference between the two ports.Anker sells two different external batteries with the same capacity, 10,000mAh: the [[ASIN:B005NGKR54 Anker® Astro3]] and the [[ASIN:B009USAJCC Anker® Astro3E]].  Here are the main differences, according to Anker customer support on Amazon:\\\\\\\\\"1, Astro3 can only be charged via AC adapter,while Astro3E can be charged via USB port of Laptop/PC/wall charger.2, The maximum current of Astro3 is 2A,while Astro3E is 3A.3, Astro3 has a DC output(9V~12V) which can charge some cameras,while Astro3E only have USB output(5V).\\\\\\\\\"So, in my words:1. The Astro3 can only be charged with the AC adapter they provide you.  The plug is proprietary.  The Astro3E can be charged with any micro-USB to USB cable and USB-AC adapter, but be sure that your AC adapter has an output current of 1A or higher (checkthe adapter to make sure).2. The Astro3 can charge devices that require a 2A current, while the Astro3E can charge faster at 3A.  If your device doesn\\'t need that much current though, then the two batteries will probably behave the same way.3. Astro3 has a DC output, while the 3E doesn\\'t.  This may or may not be relevant to you.4. Astro3 comes with more adapters so that more devices can be plugged into it, while the 3E comes with just 4 adapters, for micro-USB, mini-USB, and two others I don\\'t recognize.So if you\\'re trying to decide between these two battery packs, hopefully these differences will help you.\\n1 YEAR 1 MONTH UPDATE: Like a beast it is still rocking. Charge times have not changed. Battery time is still the same. I am really amazed. And having modified the Otterbox to fit it I am really quite content. I cannot compare to any other batteries in this size as I have no need since this has done it\\'s job for the last year without pause.UPDATE ON BATTERY TIME: Using the phone on the lowest brightness I got 117.5 hours = 4 days 19 hours of runtime. Using the phone at the brightest screen setting I got 64.5 hours = 2 days and 16 hours of runtime. Charging from 0% took 12 hours but I found a glitch, it will say 100% at 6 hours, but when you unplug it, it drops down to 60% or so. Plug it back in and charge it to 100% in another 6 hours. This battery truly does rock.UPDATE ON SIGNAL STRENGTH: I decided to try the free apps. After testing I may need to try the paid apps or just call it quits on testing. I used 2 apps. Cell Signal Strength and Network Signal Strength. I turned WiFi off. I restarted the phone so nothing but the DBM apps were running. I used the ZeroLemon and the Samsung battery included with the phone. Guess what folks? Both batteries returned the same results no matter in the 3 places I stood. This was the highest score GSM STR: 22 LTE RSRP: 99DBM They fluctuated but mostly came back to these numbers. This is why I may need to try the paid apps. I still honestly think that signal strength in Arizona is the issue and not the battery. I just don\\'t know. I get calls and internet almost everywhere it just slows down dramatically indoors. Sorry for the inconclusive results.UPDATE ON CASE MOD: Used a dremel on the OTTERBOX DEFENDER inner plastic case, cut out the size of the battery. Fits perfectly with the silicon skin to hold it all together (really fits perfectly) and I still have the corners of the phone protected by the case. I am really glad I altered the DEFENDER case to fit this battery. Like walking around with a brick now. And looking at it you can\\'t really tell that it holds this monster battery. If you own the DEFENDER, do yourself a favor and mod it. You will not regret it.UPDATE: Just found out about modding my OTTERBOX DEFENDER to fit this battery. Will do it this week and say if it is worth destroying a OTTERBOX for. I have been dying for a good protective case. The one provided is fine but not drop rated. Glad I got a spare case to play with. Anyways battery still going strong.Just got it today. Fast ass delivery, thanks Amazon.Packaging was simplistic and beautiful. Well done zip-lock bag. I like that. This thing is heavy, never forget your phone just on weight alone.Opened it up, they have directions printed on the battery, at first I thought it was in some sort of plastic shell, realized the whole thing was the battery.(Damn you Amazon let me post my own pics) Popped out old battery and jacked this one in, was scared to press down on the extended part of the battery but it gave and locked in, tight fit, excellent design.Snapped the cover on, seems ok. It does bulk up the phone quite a bit and makes you feel like you are carrying a Mid-early 90\\'s Cell phone. Not a bad thing.Came charged at 53% and in an hour was up to 79%, 10mins later it was at 81%, you do the math. I think that is a great rate for such a battery.I am thoroughly impressed. Sadly I cannot use my Otterbox Defender obviously. So for long trips this suits me and for reg day stuff I will go back to my Defender/Samsung combo.Will update on battery life. As time goes on. As of writing 30 mins added 5%Update 10: Battery still running strong, only one thing has become of any concern and that is loss of signal in buildings. This could be attributed to weather or my provider AT&T. I honestly don\\'t know. It just seems since summer started that I find it harder to get a signal indoors. At home no problem and while driving not an issue but when I enter a building, I tend to get about a 50% chance of connecting. Otherwise I cannot complain about the battery life nor will I. I really like the fact I can run this all day and not have to even think about charging. The back cover has also taken a beating and stays true to form. For the price and the longevity, this battery is a best buy.Update 9: 6.5 hours till 100% charge. This thing is beast. I will now update monthly. I never seem to run out of power, interesting note: sometimes the battery percentage increases. Strange.Update 8: Charging now, I will time how long until 100% and both icons appear.Update 7: 57 hours later and we hit 3%. I say incredible, holy s***. I am constantly on some app doing one thing or another and it lasted this long. Max Screen brightness was about 8 hours.Update 6: 39 hours without plugging in and it is 30%. Really good!Update 5: 27 hours no charging. 66% left! Amazing!Update 4: 17 hours unplugged. Went on the road, phone calls, Google maps, texting, FB, web search, screen brightness maxed. You get the point. 78% BAM! About 7% lost while out for a few hours.Update 3: Unplugged 14 hours ago. 85% with varying usage. Going on the road for about 2 hours where most of the workload will be done on the phone, we shall see how it puts up with heavy use.Update 2: According to the phone, battery is fully charged now, both 100% icons show. Might get an App to verify but that is only 6.5 hours to full. Not bad from 53%Update 1: Approximately 4 hours and it is 100% They say 12 hours to fully charge.

After owning the Mophie pack for a short time, the charging slot on the unit will become loose (happened on all four units) and eventually will not work. Furthermore, Mophie does not offer the manufacturer standard 2400 MAH charging pack (unlike the standard on the Maxboost). Their normal unit comes with a 1500 MAH charging battery. Now, let me please let the readers know, after doing a little research, I purchased two 2400 MAH &#34;Maxboost&#34; units. One for an IPhone 5 and one for an Iphone 4. All I can say is, &#34;What a difference!&#34; The quality, workmanship and functions are very nice. The charging connection is quality and one I believe will last much longer than the Mophie. Best yet, the units cost is $69.95 versus the way overrated Mophie at $99.95. If anyone reading this wants to throw money away, buy the Mophie. If you want quality, and probably two additional charges on your phone away from home at a much cheaper price, buy the Maxboost. I have had both units now and the choice is obvious, with absolutely NO apprehension at all, MAXBOOST!\\nI needed a portable charger for my iPhone and I didn\\'t want to spend so much money for a portable charger case at the store so I bought this and it works amazing! When I lose battery I just plug in my phone and voil&aacute;! Love it :)\\nI\\'m very happy with this product. It took about 2.5 hrs to fully charge on my pc. After that, I used it to charge my iPhone 5 & it worked great.\\nI have been very pleased with this battery isolator to say the least. I have not had an ounce of issue with it.  I have it installed in the engine compartment on my pickup truck to allow alternator charging of an onboard battery in my slide-in truck camper.  The heat from the engine compartment has not bothered it, in the least.Pleased with the water tightness of its make and the durability.  Very little noise heard when the coils are energized, just enough that I can tell it is engaging from the a quiet cab.I like the high amperage capacity for which I am able to start my truck with the marine battery in the camper, with the flip of a switch.  Never found on remote backwoods again without the ability to be able to start my vehicle.  :)\\n-------------- Update 8/2014 -----------------The battery is still holding a charge and works properly. However the battery has started to bulge in between the two of the cells. It appears as a small separation and TPU case becomes very tight because of the bulge. No odd or extra heat being given off during charging or use.----------------------------------------------I currently have three batteries for my Samsung Galaxy S3; 2100mAh (stock), 3000mAh (Digital Energy), and this one... the big boy 7000mAh battery.I was concerned about the TPU surround case frankly, but it worked perfect and in fact better than other cases. For a size comparison, this 7000mAh case size is almost identical to my Digital Energy 3000mAh battery + larger door. So really, why bother with the 3000mAh unless you really want a \\\\\\\\\"stock\\\\\\\\\" look to your phone. There isn\\'t a reason. Here are your pros and cons:Pros:** Days of power rather than hours.** The battery and case fit really well.** Not any thicker than a 3000mAh kit from Digital Energy.** Ship time was 3 days.Cons:** You need to grab an external charger. Charge time takes a while.** If you are worried about the added weight, then this isn\\'t for you.** Recommend 5 charge / discharge cycles. This is a 2 month job because of capacity.Capacity is a double-edged sword. You will have a ton of runtime, but you will also have a ton of charge time. Just the way it goes. But at $35, and considering that it doesn\\'t make the phone bigger than 3000mAh kits, this is a no-brainer. Easily the best extended battery kit out there for the S3. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of those cheap-o external chargers. Even though they are slow, it ends up saving you time.\\nThis is a perfect battery for anyone who has ever had their phone/tablet die before the end of the day.  I was considering the Mophie juice pack powerstation PRO, but I\\'m so glad I found the Jackery Giant before I got the Mophie.  The Mophie only has 6,000 mAh of power, and the Giant has 10,400 mAh, a 73% increase over the Mophie.  And the price?  $100 for the Mophie and only $60 for the Giant!Now, the Mophie does have an advantage of being IP-65 rated (dust and water protection), so if you plan on using your battery in that kind of environment, it\\'s a better fit.  But you could just as easily buy a nice waterproof case for the Giant and be extra careful on when you take it out.I\\'ve had it for almost 2 weeks and it works as advertised.  The flashlight is not that powerful, but it\\'s a bonus feature that I wasn\\'t expecting, so it\\'s a plus.  You do need your own USB cord to charge your device, but even with a $19 Apple Lightning cable, you\\'ll still have money (and battery capacity) left over versus the Mophie.  Finally, the battery is rated to last at least 500 full cycles for over 80% original RSOC (Relative State of Charge, or 80% of 10,400 mAh = 8,320 mAh).  I\\'ll be sure to update this review if anything changes.\\nThis review covers the Maxboost Defender Air Battery Case and gives you a complete review ofthe product and its size, box contents, features, and highlights.I purchased the Maxboost Defender Air about a week ago and I was quite frankly impressedwith it for several reasons. The box was well designed and looked professional. Inside the box amicro-USB charging / syncing cable was included as well as a brief manual.Most Importantly*The battery was able to fully re-charge the iPhone 5 in a very short period of time. The phone isnow able to last all day long even while being subjected an array of power demanding tests.The case also offers enough protection to make me feel confident that if I dropped my phonefrom a short distance I would be protected.The case comes in two colors, a matte black and also a glossy white.The case itself is exceptionally light and thin. The fact that this small unit has a 2,000mAhintegrated battery is very good compared to other cases in the industry. The buttons alongside theentire case were easy to manipulate and seem to be able to handle a bit of abuse which I inflictedon them. Also, the two-piece design is as user friendly as they come. Simply, slide the top pieceonto the bottom piece using the guide rails on the top piece.The Defender also comes with speaker holes to allow for original sound levels. As per thecustom, when it comes to battery cases the Defender uses an LED system to determine theamount of battery power remaining in the cases. I do like that they placed the LED indicator onthe bottom of the case instead of on the back.The look of the case might be a little bland for some but the black look of the case makes theiPhone look sleek even with a case on. Also the matte texture of the case is nice for people whodon\\'t want theirphone to slip out of their hands since glossy textures have a tendency to be a bitslippery.Overall, I would highly recommend this case. Not only does the case have a powerful batterywhich gets the job done, but it looks and feels great.\\nim a teenage girl and i have an android phone. if you have an android or smartphone you should know it dies very fast. when i got this item i was very surprised at how it looks. my dad says it looks cheap because the design is on the inside of the clear part. but i think its cute. it brings out the design more. buuut it came charged and i was shocked because people were saying that it came dead. my phone was on 4% when i first opened the package. and after about 25 minutes it was on 52%. it takes ALOT to charge my phone too! so i was very pleased with that. it also came with different charger heads so i can also charge my ipod & PSP. it didnt come with directions but its clear as day to know how to work it. if you plug it up to an computer theres a red light to signal you that its dead and it turns another color to let you know its fully charged. i would say that the longest this has lasted today was 2 hours so far. im trying not to let it overcharge because that can give your item an shortage. so that might be other peoples problems too so try to avoid that too\\nI\\'ve had this battery for a week now and all I can say is that I wish this is the battery every Samsung Galaxy phone could come with. It is bigger than the original battery, of course, but the bulk is not annoying and it does not make your phone look ugly or aesthetically incongruent. In fact, the back cover adds an aerodynamic feel and look to the phone, which I like. My only concern is now to find a suitable case for the phone because with the added weight I am not sure the phone will sustain a drop above 4 feet without breaking the screen.The instructions indicate that for optimal performance you should charge the battery completely and let it plugged in past the 100% indicator for a couple of hours more and run it through a full cycle (from 100% to 0%) three to five times. I did that and can go about 36 hours with no charge. In a couple of occasions I\\'ve managed two full days with moderate use! I am a heavy user of text, video, music and photos, with the occasional phone as well.NFC works like a charm as well. I have used it to make purchases at the local CVS and Walgreens and to pay for taxi rides, never having a problem.  I was able to transfer photos with S-Beam with no problems either.I am very satisfied with this battery and have ordered a second one to have as a backup.\\nI have been looking for a battery charger for iPad and iPhone for several months now, but didn\\'t like the products I found. I read a review of the Jackery Giant, and I was first impressed just by the design of the device. I mainly use the charger in my car, or I stick it in my back pocket when I\\'m taking lots of photos with my iPhone camera. I also like how you can both charge the battery charger and your mobile device at the same time. While the Giant is a little heavy, that\\'s not a huge problem for me since I don\\'t carry around the charger like I do with my Apple devices. So far I only use the charger about once a week, and the device doesn\\'t seem to lose much charge when not being used. It does take about 10 hours to fully charge Giant, but that means simply charging it overnight, and you\\'re good to go. Most of all, the price for this charger is just right.\\nI would\\'ve loved to grab the white version, but since it had terrible reviews I grabbed the black Mophie Juicepack for my SIII.  I actually got the SIII because of Mophie\\'s reputation and the fact that the SIII is one of the few Android phones they make a battery case for.I\\'m so glad I did.  Both the Juicepack and the phone itself perform amazingly.  When I use the charger properly, I can be unplugged for 24 hours, spend 4 hours talking, 2 hours texting, and 4-6 hours of general app usage split evenly between 4G and Wifi, and still have some juice left over.  Additionally, the pack is Sturdy, doesn\\'t add too much weight, attaches and detaches easily, and the buttons work with a high quality and great responsiveness.  My suggestion?  Go read all the terrible reviews and comments on the white version, and then come back here knowing the OPPOSITE is true with this model and ORDER IT IMMEDIATELY!This product is Absolutely 100% worth the investment.\\nWas able to charge iPhone 5 from 0 to full a couple of times.  Charged iPad up 30% from the fully charged Jackery Mini.  It is wonderful to have this little bit of reserve power when you are stranded.  For the money this is a good value.  Will most likely purchase their Giant as well for international travel.\\nI believed I was using this charger incorrectly...  I plugged it into a power strip that we have in our bedroom for cell phone charging, necessary bedroom evil I believe, I dropped in the battery and the color changed from blue to hot pink or red.  It does take a long time to charge, but I believe this is better for the battery in the long run. It DOES charge before my cell phone goes red, which work for me.  Why do I need it to charge in an hour, if it takes my \\\\\\\\\"in use\\\\\\\\\" battery to discharge in maybe 6-8 hours of heavy use.This is the catch that people might miss... after the battery is fully charged, the charger turns back to blue.  Remove the charger AND battery from the wall outlet, and switch batteries and plug it back in, the light is now red.  If you just exchange batteries into a plugged in unit, the charger does not know you switched batteries until you power cycle the charger.  I have other chargers that require this procedure as well...So far, it works awesome!BTW:  I moved the charger from the bedroom... didn\\'t like the airport runway light blazing all night long.  It is a bright BLUE LED... a VERY VERY bright BLUE LED!UPDATE March 6, 2013:  I read someones review that the battery falls out when it is plugged into a wall outlet...  and I had just purchased some velcro straps for other uses, the straps work perfectly with this unit also!  And a side benefit, when we travel, my spare battery is housed safely and securely in the charging unit.  I posted a picture of the velcro strap as well!  Just search for these straps on Amazon: C2G / Cables to Go - 29856 - 11in Velcro Hook and Loop Cable Straps Bright Multi-Color 12Pk\\nI got this because we live in Oklahoma and we lose power on a regular basis during tornado season.  I wanted a way to be able to charge our cell phones in case of an emergency without being reliant on power, or on me plugging something in ahead of time to charge it.In addition to the emergency aspect, we recently used this on a trip to New York City, when we were out and about for almost 15 hours in one day, seeing the sights.  I threw it in my bag (fully charged already) and we used it throughout the day to keep our iPhones topped off.This is a really smart investment for anyone with cell phones, tablets, or other small devices which can be powered via USB.  I imagine that this will be especially useful during the first few weeks of the zombie apocalypse, and that\\'s the most critical time for survival.  Totally worth the price.\\nAfter considering many different battery cases for my iphone5, I chose this one. The deception I speak of is this --> it is advertised as \\\\\\\\\" Lightning Connector Integrated\\\\\\\\\". Be aware what this means is the connector inside the case IS the Lightning connector, you get an additional cord to plug into your case and it is a micro-B (micro USB ) the type you would use on the Bluetooth ear piece. If you are ok with that, then by all means, get this one.I like the feel and the look of this product. Time will tell if this is this product is the great choice I hope it to be. I will try to add my pics to product pics to help others in their decision making. 2-22-13 Update- charger fits excellent, protects iPhone 5 great. The feel of the material makes in and out of pocket easy. I would recommend this case to others.\\nThis video review covers the Maxboost Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5 (the black version). The video talks about weight, size, features, and basic how-to instructions on using the phone case. For a more detailed review of the case in text please continue reading for an overview of the case. The Maxboost Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5 was quite the surprise (in a good way). Upon receiving the product I noted the well-designed packaging which included everything I wanted to know about the product without overwhelming me with technical specifications which can leave anyone cross-eyed. The contents within the packaging include a micro-USB cable for sync and charging the case (more on that later), a user\\'s manual, and the phone case itself. The user\\'s manual is concise and clear enough for most to be able to understand the basic functions of the case, as well as how to install and un-install the case. The battery case itself, is made of a black plastic which has a matte finish, this serves a purpose - to make the phone case less likely to slide all over the place compared to the white glossy finish. The fusion implements a two-piece sliding system. The first piece, a basic- protective case connects to the second piece, the battery and connector, via a sliding notch which is located on the battery component. They connect using a sliding motion where the protective case sits within the battery base component making it function as a holster (for lack of a better word). The Maxboost Fusion does come with a lightning connector built in! So the iPhone 5 finally has a real, dedicated, charging port made by a third party. Features of the Maxboost Fusion are similar to many other battery case models. The case has an LED power indicator which uses a four-light system. 4 lights for 100% charge, 3 lights for 75%, etc. It also has two speaker amplification outlets on the front of the phone for better quality sound. Theaux/audio port is buried deep within the case so listening to music with headphones will have to be done using an apple headset or a similar design to avoid the plug not fitting!As mentioned before the case comes with a micro-USB cable which can charge and sync the phone directly to the computer without removing the case. This enables users to use either a micro-USB with the case on, or the standard Apple connector with the case off. Physically the Fusion is fairly small in size compared to many other cases in the industry. The 2,000mAh battery basically doubles the life of the iPhone 5, but Maxboost managed to keep the battery small enough where users won\\'t notice an overly bulky battery hanging on the back of the phone. At most, the case adds a couple millimeters of thickness to the phone (not bad at all). Weight isn\\'t really an issue at all either, considerably lighter than many competitors.Lastly, the case does not seem to affect the flash on the camera at all. I was able to take multiple pictures in various settings without getting flashback or any other strange effects with the case attached.The Maxboost Fusion case is well done and a favorite of mine so far of all the iPhone 5 cases that I have come across or reviewed. I highly recommend this slim battery case for anyone who needs extra power, especially if you like to take the battery off and still want some form of protection for the phone.\\nIt\\'s a trade off. Pure and simple this will beef up the size of your phone. Of course by that I mean it\\'s as thick as my old Motorola phone, but I can live with that on those days I want power. If you\\'re traveling anywhere you might go out of tower range - than this can be a lifesaver. Most of the time the power for the phone to search for a signal will drain it quickly, but this battery pack means you can be worry free.I\\'ve gone all day with moderate use (some videos/music and a lot of texts) and after 20hrs was only down to 74%. With that I could probably go 3 days before charging and still never hit my \\'low power\\' alert. I do wish the cover had a little more soft protection on the corners but it still fits perfectly and none of the openings were off so I give points for that. I do think that if you\\'re going for a thicker phone for the battery, some extra protection would make sense due to the added weight.The battery does pack a good punch too - as soon as I installed it my phone came on without any delays, and my living wallpaper seemed to go at it\\'s full speed. For regular days, I get to enjoy running at top performance and don\\'t need to skimp on any of my apps or brightness.Still, I do change this battery out depending on my intended day. I have a backup regular battery that I carry for spare power when I\\'m going &#34;slim&#34; and just using a protection case, or for when I\\'m using a wallet style case to carry ID and cards. But this case is great in that it\\'s easy to pop off or on when it\\'s time to change.So for the amazing power and quality the trade-off is worth it. Your super slim GSIII will be more like a standard thickness phone but will be blazing with power, and when you want to go back to your less \\'superman\\' battery, the change is quick and easy. But for trips or long days away from a charger - this is the way to go.Good construction, seems well held together, but it is clearly 3 batteries in a single pack. Of course this makes sense considering its 3x the power.The battery was a little tricky to install the first time, so go slow and give yourself a chance to adjust to the learning curve of how to fit it in. Don\\'t force it. And hold face down to put on the cover (at first) just so you get the best fit.Amazing overall considering the price.\\nI use the daylights out of my Galaxy Note 2.  It\\'s my phone, my camera, my mp3 player, my Netlix screen, my Internet connection tether when I\\'m at remote locations.  Needless to say I can easily go through a battery or two a day.  One of the first purchases I always make after buying a cell phone is buying extra batteries.  Normally these batteries come with a cheap wall charger that takes a good 6-8 hours to fully charge a battery.Not this bad boy!  This is the factory OEM Samsung 2000mA (or 2.0A) charger.  Most of the cheap wall chargers you get are only 800mA, and with those I\\'d charge a battery before leaving the house for the day or before going to bed because it would take a good 8 hours to charge a completely drained battery.  Now with this Samsung charger I can fully charge a dead battery in the time it takes to watch a movie.The battery included is also a stock OEM Samsung battery, identical to the one in my phone.  I also bought a set of Anker batteries (and discarded the crummy 800mA charger they come with) and charged them successfully in the same short amount of time using this OEM Samsung Charger.Bottom Line: Well worth the extra money you pay for it if you\\'re impatient about waiting for batteries to charge.\\nI do hope potential buyers will find this review helpful for it seems that there is no much information available about practical use of this particular battery case:Pros:✔1. Rubberized surface, nice to touch and grip.✔2. Easy to use, simply pull the case apart (gently), slide in iPhone 5 and re-connect the case. Case is sturdy enough, which is a plus for those of us who tend to be somewhat clumsy on occasion :)✔3. Nice opening for the camera and flash, which is good if you make lots of pictures and videos.✔4. You can use one cable to recharge the case and the phone.✔5. Kickstand. A simple yet very useful feature that many other cases do not seem to use. Perfect if you use Facetime, Skype, or watch videos on your iPhone.✔6. Battery lasts for 10-12 hours easy without recharge.Cons:✔ I wish on/off button was slightly larger.Not really a con or pro, more of the personal observation - some people say that the case is rather large; I disagree, to a point. I find it solid but I do have large hands so your experience might vary. However, I would not advise carrying your iPhone 5 with ANY battery attached in your back pant\\'s pocket - since a battery does add up to the physical dimensions of the phone, and makes it less monolithic, there\\'s a possibility of sitting on it and breaking up the whole thing. I actually have a nice side-leg pocket on my favorite pair of jeans so, I don\\'t have to worry about it. Just a head\\'s up.Conclusion: For the price, this is a very solid battery case, with good battery life and a handy kickstand.Recommended.\\nI don\\'t normally write reviews of my Amazon purchases, but this one compels me to do so.  I am a long time iPhone user.  I use it heavily for work and can run it out by 5 pm with ease.  I have been through three different Mohpie battery packs going all the way back to the iPhone 3.  I am now on an iPhone 4s.  I took a chance on this case in hopes to find something better than the Mophie, who after all these years, still rely upon the week and feably top design.So whay is the Maxboost the best?  It is a case and battery pack in one.  The run time on the battery is fine, but what won me over was the ease at which the battery comes off and leaves you with a somewhat protective case still on the phone. It is then docakable as if it were a bare iPhone.  The battery goes on solid and is snug when connected.  In all respects, it has all the +\\'s of the Mophie, then goes beyond that with it\\'s fit, extra case when battery is off and the overall feel.  The microphone and speacker pots work as well or better than the Mophie and one thing they do not put in the instructions is that is can be turned off while on the phone just like the Mophie.  Just hold the power level button on the bottom and it shuts off.Another HUGE BONUS was the hole provided for the flash and the camera lens.  It is as if this company took the Mophie and then removed all the negatives.  Mophie will ALWAYS leave a haze and halo on photos taken with the camera when flash is used.  The Maxboost case has a completely modified design of the hole and there is NO haze or halo on any photo that I have taken.So I guess you can tell, I love this case.  I highly recommend it for all iPhone users looking for a solid battery boost case with all the benefits of Mophie and none of the negatives.  I can\\'t find one negative to report.  If I do, I will update.\\nI just replaced my iPhone 4 with a new iPhone 5.  I had a Morphie Juice Pack for my 4 but was shocked the AT&T store I purchased it at had no options available yet for the 5. When I purchased the Maxboost I had no idea what I would get; it seemed inexpensive in comparison to the Morphie\\'s I had purchased for my 4 and even though most of the reviews at the time of purchased were favorable the sample size was small.I have had the Maxboost now for a week and it more than exceeds expectations.  A list of pros followed by two small cons:Pros:1. Even though the battery is rated at 2,000 mAh it is much smaller in size and weight that the Morphies I have had.  Any battery case will increase the footprint of an iPhone, but I was shocked how unobtrusive this one was.2. This case is all of the 2,000 mAh it is rated at.  During the first week of use my battery has yet to fall below 100% during a given day, and I use my phone for much more than talking and texting.3. The case design is outstanding. It has the soft rubberized coating that have become ubiquitous with these cases, but to date seems very durable.  In addition, the “top half” connects to the “bottom half” by way of an integrated hinge,  (clearly shown in the images), that keeps both part together.  The top of both Morphies I owned constantly came off, particularly if they were in a tighter pocket. In addition, all of the iPhone buttons are “cut out” from the cover for easier access.4. The On/Off button is located on the rear of the case and is of the push variety; because of this, it doesn’t seem to accidently turn on or off like other toggle switches. In addition, the power indicator lights are located on the rear next to the button.  On my previous Morphies, the lights were located on the bottom, so when charging they would annoyingly blink all evening.  Although the status lights blink when the Maxboost charges, their rear location makes them invisiblewhen charging.5. As stated above, I was a bit leery of the $49.95 price point.  I know Amazon often discounts items, but after a quick stop at the Maxboost web site I found $49.95 was the MSRP. Based on the others pros listed above, the price and value of the product are phenomenal .Cons:1. The headphone receptacle jack is rather small and might not allow for the use of head phones that are oversized or oddly shaped. One caveat – I think this problem is based on the new location of the jack and seems to occur with all battery packs currently available.2. When charging or connected to your computer/iTunes a “Charging is not supported with this accessory” message will appear on your iPhone if it is turned on.  In additions, you CAN NOT synch via mini USB cable with the case on.  This shouldn’t really  matter though; either remove the case and use the lightening cable the phone came with, or, even better, synch wirelessly!I use Shure headphones, so I must remove the case if I choose to listen using them. Unless a reasonably priced alternative with better head phone accessibility arrives on the scene this will be my power source for the future.  Again, this is a great product for the price.\\nAs a regular Amazon shopper, I don\\'t normally write too many reviews but I had to write something about the i-Blason PowerSlider battery Case. I like this case very much and just ordered my second one. There is relatively very little information on the web about the unit so I figured I\\'d help out buyers like me who like to research the item before they commit to buying. So here goes:The Good:1. The PowerSlider case is reasonablly priced. The Lenmar battery case range anywhere from $90~$110 (on pre-order) which is way out of my price range for this type of product. Mophie is still nowhere to be seen.2. The i-Blason case looks good. I\\'ve got a black iPhone 5 (AT&T) and this case matches the color perfectly. Also, the PowerSlider has a nice, rubberized finish which compliments the iPhone and makes it easy to hold.3. It works. With 2,200 mAh capacity,  I can go an entire day (13 hours) without recharging my phone, and that includes web surfing, sending/reading emails, and of course playing games even using AT&T 4G LTE.4. I like the kick stand. It is so convenient to use and one of main reasons I bought this case. But, I do wish they made this stand a bit more sturdy.5. Buttons, openings and controls all works great. I Had no issues.The Bad:1. The PowerSlider does add some considerable bulk to your slim iPhone. Both in thickness and in height.2. The case adds extra weight (mainly from the battery) so throwing it in your pockets may be uncomfortable. But not too bad with less than 3 ounces of mass.Bottomline:It\\'s a quality battery case that works well, compatible and reliable, and is relatively inexpensive. There are negatives, but they\\'re all superficial. If you\\'re a person who is always on the go and you don\\'t always have time to charge your phone then this case is for you. Highly recommended\\nI have a couple Morphie juice packs, however, i stumbled upon this brand and particular device via woot.com. I now carry this around with me in my work briefcase and find it indispensable. My iPhone 3gs would normally drop from 100% to 20% with little use by noon. I upgraded to the iPhone 5 and found that i use the device heavily now, and drop from 100% to 30% by late afternoon. So, I use it once a day to give my iPhone 5 a much needed energy refill in the afternoon before heading out to my evening activities. Additionally, i like that i can juice up my friends/family phones, and devices even after i have charged up my iPhone.The size of the device is great. It is thicker than the Morphie devices, but those are wider and do not fit in my jeans nicely. This does. I also like that this device has a built in led flash light as it has come in hand many times. I also like that the Enerpak fits in the palm of my hand better than the Morphie devices that are rectangles with edges and corners.The device comes with a USB 2.0 to micro USB cable that works to recharge the battery from my laptop. But i normally plug the USB 2.0 end into my iPhone wall charger as it seems to charge it quicker. Don\\'t worry about over charging as the device has cut off circuits. Overall, i am very satisfied with this device and will probably purchase a couple others as stocking stuffers for my family.Update 1/4/2013: I was asked if this battery pack works with Android phones and the answer is yes. I have charged my Kindle, iPhone 5, iPhone 4, iPod Nano, a co-worker\\'s Blackberry, a Bluetooth headset, and an Android phone. Essentially, it will charge any device that can be plugged into the USB port, you just need to supply the charging cable.[[ASIN:B009SYASSI uNu Enerpak Tube 5000mAh External Battery Pack for iPhone 5 4S 4, iPad mini, the New iPad, iPod Touch and Most Android Phones]]\\nThis is a great a back up just in case you ever need it!  Has worked perfectly every time I have used it.I have used it for both my HTC DNA and Nexus 7 and supplies around 350ma on average (this depends on what your phone is doing, how much power it is using, and works best with the screen off)I assume it does not come with documentation as it seems pretty obvious.  But for those having issues, all you do is plug in the supplied usb cable to the battery and connect it to your phone or device.  To recharge it, flip the cord around and plug the micro usb side into the battery and attach the usb plug into your computer or compatible cell phone charger.\\nThis is a great a back up just in case you ever need it!

The phone kept shutting off at unexpected times and the battery would not last long even though the meter showed a lot of charge. This battery took care of all that. Very happy!\\nEDIT - September 2015: I can finally end this review, as the lifespan of this product has now run its course. The cells inside the case started their characteristic end-of-life bulge a couple months ago, and now the case has split its seam and is getting extra warm during charging and discharging. It still operates but I don\\'t really feel comfortable continuing to use it due to the consequences when high-powered lithium batteries ignite, so after almost 3 years of essentially daily use, I\\'m now putting it to rest.That\\'s almost 3 years of living in my left back pocket, getting crushed on chairs and concrete shop floors, being used almost every day, and often multiple times per day. 3 years of saving my hide and keeping me from having to worry about how much power I have left in my phone. 3 years of being Johnny-on-the-spot when a friend complains about needing a place to plug in. 3 years of solid reliability, despite a lifetime of unrelenting physical and electrical abuse. I actually have a couple pairs of jeans with holes worn in the lower edge of the pocket where the corners of this battery would rub them into whatever surfaces I find myself sitting on.I\\'ve gotten a hell of a lot of use out of this thing, and my review remains at a well-deserved 5 stars.--EDIT - Nov. 2014  It\\'s been the better part of two years since I wrote the review that follows, and as it is sometimes bewildering to think about, this is actually a LONG time in the world of gadgets -- especially mobile electronics. Phones come and go, and the GS2 I wrote about has long since died and been replaced, for the moment with a Note3. Among my daily carryables, the Astro E3 has now been eclipsed in outline dimensions, but not in mass.I\\'m pleased to report that this thing is *still* a part of my routine, it still lives in my back pocket (where no cell phone would survive a day of my life), and it still gets pulled out all the time to allow me to keep using my phone. I get approximately two full charges of my Note3 out of it, and it remains one of the fastest USB charging sources I own.A couple minor notes from my experience with this device, one good and one thing I\\'m going to complain about for a bit. First, this product has what may be an unintentional but very intuitive feature that I\\'ve seen omitted or prevented in some other battery products -- that is, the ability to plug in and charge the battery while simultaneously it is discharging into another device. The Astro E3 charges at a lower rate than it discharges, so the result is a net discharge, until the other device is full. This is super convenient when your sources of USB power are limited. Just plug the Astro E3 into a power source, and then plug your other devices into it. In the morning, everything will be charged.That is, everything unless you have a low-power device that takes a long time charging at a low current draw. Anker\\'s design (which I understand is not unique) includes an arbitrary current threshold, below which it doesn\\'t feel it\\'s necessary to provide power. This fails its intended purpose in my case, in at least two ways. My phone, when plugged in, has a quiescent draw when fully (100%) charged, that will keep the battery providing power indefinitely. To be clear I don\\'t think this is wrong, but for whatever reason it\\'s specifically what Anker was trying to avoid. On the other hand, a legitimate task like charging a bluetooth headset fails because it doesn\\'t draw enough power to satisfy the battery\\'s weird minimum requirement.This in my mind is a bad design choice. It\\'s an attempt to be smarter than your users and it just ends up being pointless and annoying. Perhaps the option should be available to behave this way, but it (a) should not be a default, and in any case (b) the user certainly should be able to drive any USB power-consuming device from this battery, without having to guess whetherthe battery finds the load &#34;acceptable&#34;.That said, I\\'m not changing my 5-star review. As much as this misfeature bothers me, it\\'s just not enough to deduct from my score. This battery has been a solid, durable daily companion for many months, spending a good part of its time being sat on, dropped, stepped on, and generally abused like something I don\\'t think or care about until that moment when I need it.And now for the original review, unedited:~~~~~~~~~~I don\\'t actually like giving 5-star reviews, and on this one I hovered over 4 stars thinking to myself, well ... what\\'s actually wrong with it? What can I deduct a star for?  It doesn\\'t actually charge itself magically from the luminiferous ether, it doesn\\'t fly or bake cookies, and it definitely doesn\\'t impress the ladies. Maybe they\\'ll work these features in.I\\'ve just received it and used it a couple times, so maybe I\\'ll find a serious problem with it in the future. But for now, I\\'m really impressed with the apparent quality and functionality of the device. I can\\'t really find anything serious to complain about.Make no mistake, this thing is not subtle. It\\'s bigger and heavier than my Galaxy SII (a fairly large-screen phone), though the dimensions are comparable with the phone when my rubber case is on it. It\\'s massive, like a plate of armor or a piece of a big stone tile, and feels nearly as dense and solid. At 37Wh of capacity and up to 3A of current, the size and mass is definitely justified though, and it\\'s obvious that they didn\\'t waste any internal volume with hollow spaces in the enclosure. It hangs heavy in your pocket, but then we knew that was the deal before we bought a 10 amp-hour auxiliary battery, didn\\'t we?As an aside, this is the kind of thing that seems to deserve its own new kind of clothing to carry and conceal it. Since it\\'s mainly going to be tech geeks who are interested in carrying around so much gadget fuel, and nerds like me tend to have a pretty substantial anterior pelvic tilt from sitting in front of computers all the time, maybe there\\'s a market for some kind of garment that will hide a device like this in the curvature of the lower back, providing an &#34;outlet&#34; through your clothing somewhere around the belt.Anyway, they get a top score for build quality and functionality, as I see it so far. Though I haven\\'t done any deliberate timed trials, I don\\'t own any other charging device of any kind that seems to charge my phone as quickly as this battery does.

Dissatisfied by the majority of existing reviews on the DX Plus, I decided to create something that would give the average consumer, like me, a glimpse of the product before committing to a purchase.As a consultant, I run a hectic schedule that demands mobility and flexibility. Being on a conference call for an hour while driving or working at a client site can be taxing on my iPhone\\'s battery, which initially led me to look for a viable solution to additional battery power. Enter the DX Plus.The Good:1. Competitively priced with a great balance of quality and reliability.2. The DX Plus echoes the aesthetics of the iPhone\\'s design, especially the glossy white and silver trim. And speaking of design, the battery case feels like a cohesive unit. No clumsy wires or additional cables to carry around.3. It works, and then some. I can go an entire day without plugging in my phone to a wall charger, and that includes web surfing, sending/reading emails, and running various apps.The Bad:1. The DX Plus will add some considerable bulk to your slim iPhone.2. The DX Plus adds extra weight.Bottom-line:At 2,400mah, the DX Plus was aimed at a specific target market - power users. That\\'s 10 hours of extra talk time! I\\'ve checked the power capacities of other brands and the DX Plus has more juice than most. Indeed, this thing will make your iPhone feel like a mini-tank, but in my humble opinion that\\'s a small tradeoff for the convenience and peace of mind in knowing that you won\\'t be stuck without power when you need it most.\\nCompared\\\\tested the Hyperion against the original SamsungI recently purchased the Note 2 and decided to purchase a couple spare batteries as I had for my previous phone. I\\'m reviewing the batteries here.The same test was executed on both battery brands.1) Condition: Start battery charged at 100%2) Condition: Blue Tooth on, streaming Braveheart movie on Netflix through wireless home network to phone.Test duration: 184 minutes, movie and creditsResult Hyperion: After test phone shows 70% battery life remaining.Result Samsung: After test phone shows 68% battery life remaining.3) Condition: Made phone call with Bluetooth on.Test duration: 99 minutesResult Hyperion: After test phone shows 60% battery life remaining.Result Samsung: After test phone shows 59% battery life remaining.4) Condition: Start GPS with music running in background and Bluetooth on.Test duration: 60 minutes RanResult Hyperion: After test phone shows 44% battery life remaining.Result Samsung: After test phone shows 44% battery life remaining.5) Condition: Start music running and Bluetooth on.Test duration: 60 minutes.Result Hyperion: After test phone shows 40% battery life remaining.Result Samsung: After test phone shows 40% battery life remaining.6) Condition: Blue Tooth on, streaming legends of the Fall movie on Netflix through wireless home network to phone.Test duration: 134 minutesResult Hyperion: After test phone shows 13% battery life remaining.Result Samsung: After test phone shows 15% battery life remaining.Batteries tested:Hyperion 3100mAh paid $24.98 for 2 batteries and a stand alone chargerSamsung 3100mAh battery came with phoneNote: Plan to include Anker battery at a later date.Summary: I was totally surprised by the results. I expected the original Samsung battery to outperform  the low cost Hyperion battery by a good margin. I definitely rate this Hyperion as 5 stars based on this comparison as well as the low cost of $24.98 which included 2 batteries and a stand alone charger. I plan to repeat this test after 2-3 months (feb 2013)of usage to see if results degrade with time\\\\use. I really believe my tests are more demanding than an average day of use the phone\\\\battery would receive. Personally I needed an extra battery because I use my phone to power my blue tooth head set and the phone GPS to plot my tracts when skiing all day and then to stream movies to my TV at night after a wonderful day on the slopes.\\nI\\'m currently in high school and I needed a big enough battery pack to charge all of my devices on the go. And this Is GREAT. Was kind of skeptical at first because I never heard of the company before. But it ended up being the best buy I have ever made on Amazon. This thing can charg my phone and tablet over 8 times. I usually charge it up Sunday night and use it for the rest of the week. And the price is perfect. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!\\nI read a lot of the reviews and despite some concern about the people who said they got what appeared to be used devices and in some cases DOA devices I took the risk.  Risk 1 me 0.  Device\\'s button when pressed caused nothing to light up.  Plugged it into an ac charger and all 4 lights just constantly started blinking.  Let it charge for a few hours came back plugged in an iphone and got nothing.  Button still didn\\'t cause any status lights to come on.  Returning for a refund.***UPDATE***I am adding 2 stars as appreciation for the customer support team at Anker who reached out to me after the negative review and offered to send me another unit gratis to prove the product\\'s merits.  The second unit was received quickly and is functioning so far as planned (I will note that it wouldn\\'t push my iPhone 4s to 100% without some extra button pressing.  Stopped around 96% then I had to push the charge button about 4 more times to get it all the way to 100%).  Also note that this unit does work perfectly well with the Google Nexus 7.  Went from nearly 0% to fully charged overnight using this unit.  Also note that if you have problems with your device update your feedback here on Amazon.  Their customer support team seems to be more tuned into the feedback here than their own support site which I opened a ticket with before ever leaving feedback and didn\\'t hear from until a day or so later.  I will return in 6 months time and rate this device higher if it continues to function as I would expect and doesn\\'t experience any of the failures or other oddities that some have noted in previous reviews.***UPDATE 2***Device is still rocking after all this time with no issues.  Raising the review to 5 stars!\\nFor those readers that are reading this review on the Item page, this review is for the Astro3E 10000mAh charger. Since Amazon mixes reviews with all different \\\\\\\\\"variants\\\\\\\\\" of a product, and this comes in multiple capacities, this makes it hard to separate reviews.This product does what it advertises, and does it VERY well. It comes with a nice mesh case which I carry it in constantly, and a nice little coiled USB cord with a few tips. While these aren\\'t compatible with every device I own, I use it mainly to charge my phone, which is MicroUSB and included.Some devices I have tried charging: - I own a Motorola Droid 4, and I have charged the phone from dead to full over 4 times on a single charge. Android and Apple ports work, but on the Android port, the Droid 4 actually charges FASTER than the stock plug-in charger. My phone does not seem to mind. - An LG Ally charges on either port, but faster on the Android port. - A Nintendo DS Lite (with a compatible USB cord) charges on either port. - An iPod Nano 6th Generation charges on the Apple port. It does not respond on the Android port. I have charged this device from dead to full, and did lose enough capacity on the battery for it to register.I will update this review with more results as I charge more devices. I\\'m going on a few flights in the next couple of months, so this charger will gets LOTS of use.\\nMy Galaxy SII (Sprint), started to lose signal, and randomly shut down. When I\\'d boot it back up, it\\'d tell me to plug in the charger, if I turned it off and back on, it\\'d say I had 64% battery, this went on for a couple months before I read up and found that the battery is only good for a set number of plug-in\\'s and charges. I figured dropping $18 on this was better than dealing with the morons at Sprint.Seriously thrilled I bought this, not one issue with my phone anymore, and now, with normal usage, I\\'m getting 2+ full days of usage between charges.Lesson learned though. I don\\'t plug in my phone unless it tells me to, and I don\\'t unplug unless it\\'s fully charged.If you\\'re have issues, this is def a nice alternative to try out rather than taking it in.\\nI\\'ve tested a number of batteries for the GS3 and now starting with the GN2 with a CBA-III/CBA-IV battery analyzer. It\\'s become a personal project of mine since the last QCell battery I got had plastic spacers inside where other batteries had battery. I\\'m glad to report that this battery appears to be legitimate.I\\'m kind of surprised and concerned to see that I\\'m the first verified reviewer for this battery.  All the other reviewers came out of the woodwork making their first reviews on amazon for a product they got elsewhere...I\\'ve included a chart from my test results comparing the Hyperion and QCell batteries in my first comment - and they\\'re practically equal.  QCell delivers about 3200mAh per battery with a 500mA load.  With a higher load of 2000mA, the rating would be about 3125mAh capacity.The included charger has a usb charging port and is no worse or better than any other brand\\'s included charger -- or any of the GS3\\'s chargers. It appears to be the same as the GS3 charger, but with the prongs rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees so the battery sticks out to the right. This means that it\\'s slow as ever - and will take longer to charge than a GS3 battery because the battery has higher capacity.This battery delivers what it promises, but I\\'m concerned about the number of first time reviewers that just had to comment on how great the battery is.  Based on battery capacity alone, I would recommend it.Based on the practices of QCell I have seen: small cells in batteries and filling the space with plastic, campaign downvoting of negative reviews and revealing customer pictures, spamming the customer images to hide revealing photos, putting sockpuppet 1-star first-review reviews on competitors products, putting positive sockpuppet 5-star first-review reviews on their products, I would never recommend a QCell product.\\nI purchased the Anker Astro2 charger in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy. I knew we would likely be without power for 1-2 weeks, and needed to have a backup charger for my cell phone and iPad. After an initial charge of about 6 hours, the Anker was able to charge my iPhone 5 and my iPad simultaneously. It gave them both a full charge and had one \\\\\\\\\"battery indicator light\\\\\\\\\" left afterwards. I was able to get about a half charge of my iPhone after that. After fully charging the Anker a second time, I have found that it will give my iPhone 5 almost three full charges. This item was an invaluable purchase for us. We were without power and land-line telephone service for 8 days and would have been lost without it. I hope that it continues to work as well as it has so far.\\nTo make a long story short, I\\'ve turned it into a personal project to test all sorts of batteries that people are likely to run into numerous dishonest sellers.  This is after a QCell battery I got for my Galaxy S3 turned out to have plastic spacers inside where legitimate batteries have battery.I bought and tested this battery and the results are good.  I use a CBA-III battery analyzer to determine the capacity using real world type parameters.  (3.2v cutoff, 500mA load).  The chart with both batteries is in the first comment.Battery #1: 3215mAhBattery #2: 3260mAhThis is about 105% of the advertised capacity.  The picture shown is not of this battery and charger - the battery actually goes sideways instead of vertically.  It still charges as slow as all the other slow charging chargers - and this one takes even longer because it has higher capacity (than a S3 standard battery).  Picture of the funny charger included in customer images.You wouldn\\'t really think that the battery business is so cutthroat, but already there are three 1-star unverified reviews and all the verified reviews have \\\\\\\\\"not helpful\\\\\\\\\" votes.  All the verified reviews are positive.\\nI received this Hyperion battery and back cover for my Galaxy S3 quickly. Cover looked good, battery seemed to work well. Added weight, but I didn\\'t mind. I just wanted a reliable long life battery. Worked great....for about 20 days. Now it dies faster than OEM battery half the thickness. I am very disappointedAMENDMENT-  Please note that I was just contacted by Hyperion. They apologized for the bad battery and sent me a replacement right away. The next battery I received works great and hasn\\'t lost any power. Very happy with cover AND battery now! Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of the first bad battery, but highly recommend. Nice lonnng life battery!!UPDATE- A person having trouble with their battery asked me to update my listing about my \\\\\\\\\"replaced\\\\\\\\\" battery to see how it is. All is well and its still working fine. Good thing Hyperion replaced the defective one with a good one, so I gave high rating now. Sorry some others got a dud. Call Hyperion if that happens!\\nI purchased this Chromo Inc. battery case for my IPhone 4S several weeks ago which was a risk considering many of the reviews. I didn\\'t need a battery case that charged 2 or 3 times the IPhone\\'s battery life - just one that would provide  3 to 4 hours extra time in case I forget to charge my phone at night. I did not want to have to carry around an extra battery pack and I also did not want to spend $90+ for it. At less than $15, the Chromo has worked well for me. It actually charged my IPhone 4S from 0 to 100% and takes a relatively short time.It IS possible to charge the IPhone AND the Chromo battery case at the same time, using the enclosed mini usb cable! (Yay!) BE SURE to turn the battery switch to the \\\\\\\\\"ON\\\\\\\\\" position  when charging. The charge time for both IPhone and the Chromo is longer than individual charges, but much more convenient.The case itself is a sturdy semi-flexible rubber-like plastic which comes in 2 pieces that are easily removed. 4 lights on the back of the battery caseindicate the charge progress.This inexpensive little gadget is well worth the money I paid for it.\\nDon\\'t be as dumb as I was...be sure to check that the battery you buy is for the carrier you use. I bought this battery in preparation for a trip to Europe. Today when I went to put it in, it didn\\'t fit. Why? It\\'s for a T-Mobile phone SII, not a Sprint SII. Who knew that the same phone would be configured two different ways for two different carriers? Probably lots of people but I wasn\\'t one of them. I know phones are locked into certain carriers but it never even crossed my mind to check to see that the battery was for a Sprint phone. Too late now for a return. I do not fault the seller in any way, it says in the description T-Mobile but I didn\\'t even notice that fact. It would be nice if somehow the fact that it would only work in T-Mobile phones was put in bold in the description to alert dummies like me.Still, if it had fit my phone, it would have been a great price.\\nAfter receiving the OR3 I was immediately impressed with the packaging and the quality and feel of the product.  I immediately paired the device.  Took me a sec before I had to read the instructions to find out about holding the power button for 10 seconds to enter pairing mode but once I took the time to read and do it correctly it paired flawlessly with my Galaxy Nexus and my Nexus 7.  Let me start off by saying what this speaker is NOT so you insane people that expect THX DOLBY DIGITAL sound out of a 6 inch sphere will calm down.  It is not a home stereo, car stereo or larger driver replacement by any stretch.  That being said it will RIVAL if not BEAT any BLUETOOTH - PORTABLE - RECHARGEABLE speaker in the \\\\\\\\\"under $200.00 range\\\\\\\\\".  That\\'s saying a TON since I bought this shipped to my door for under $50.00To test this theory I took my OR3 to Target and Best Buy yesterday and compared it to several more popular and well known units.My main conclusion was I can not for the life of me imagine why anyone would buy the small Jambox for $50 much less almost $200.  The OR3 absolutely destroys the small Jambox in every aspect.  The Large Jambox is definitely on another level in terms of sound but in my humble opinion the sound quality vs. price ratio is WAY out of whack.  It\\'s literally 6 TIMES more then the OR3.  It\\'s definitely not 6 times better.  Logitech makes a larger unit I tested it against that was $169.  In terms of sound the logitech was a bit better but it was also the size of a small 1980\\'s boom box and had a fraction of the battery life and I don\\'t even think it ran on rechargeable (don\\'t quote me on that).  There were several other units I tested against (all being in the mid hundred dollar range) and the OR3 was as good and or better then all of them that I didn\\'t individually mention above.  Note: I get a VERY consistent bluetooth connection at 28-29 feet.  Yes I measured with a tape.  Slightly lower then the advertised 33 feet but this could just as likely be my phones fault as it is the OR3.As an Ebay Powerseller and Top Rated Seller I critique every purchase based on the level of service and quality I offer my customers.  You can purchase this item with no worries knowing ENERDROID tested and reviewed the GOgroove OR3 for you.this could just as likely be my phones fault as it is the OR3.As an Ebay Powerseller and Top Rated Seller I critique every purchase based on the level of service and quality I offer my customers.  You can purchase this item with no worries knowing ENERDROID tested and reviewed the GOgroove OR3 for you.\\nItem was shipped and received promptly. Packaged well.  I have to admit I was skeptical when I first saw this item because of it\\'s low price. A similar well marketed item from a known retailer is priced at more than double this price, but it had good reviews and good mentions in reviews of other similar products.  I have been using it for three days now and have been very impressed. I am a heavy user of data; emails, social networking, video streaming, etc.  I had 16 hours of use before the battery indicator was red.  The battery does add bulk to the Samsung S3, but the benefits outweigh the little increase in phone thickness. I don\\'t worry about my battery consumption at all.  Exceptional product.Update:  Battery cover cracked while opening, but the seller sent me replacements for free.  Battery has been functioning flawlessly.  No complaints.  Highly recommended.\\nI have a Samsung SGH-i727 Skyrocket and as soon as I purchased the phone I started looking for a backup battery. I made it a practice to carry a spare charged battery at all times because when you compare how useful it is compared to how much space it takes up on your person it really is a no brainer. I originally bought another samsung brand battery because it was made by the company that made the phone so they should know what works best for the device. After a while of using 2 stock batteries a day I researched the extended slim batteries like this one. The OEM batteries are 1850 mAh and these are 2300 mAh but they are the width as the OEM so you don\\'t have to replace the stock back and loose the sexy figure of the Rocket. I originally bought the Anker brand 2200 mAh batteries and they are another great product but these have an extra 100mAh so I bought them later and gave a friend the ankers. I can\\'t help but picture SpinalTap where the guy is showing off his amps that go to 11. Ya these batteries go to 11! Is that extra 100mAh noticeable? I honestly can\\'t say for certain but my understanding of numbers and math leads me to believe yes! The build of the batteries is actually very similar to the Ankers, In fact they both suffer the same flaw. on the top of the battery there is a plastic piece that separates the different spaces and if you use the  the included charger you will break one of the separators off. This will happen with both Anker and ec technologies. I wrote to the company and got a reply the same day that the batteries are protected by a micro chip and that the separators are basically cosmetic. If you look at the phone you can see that there is no way the connectors are going to misalign with the battery regardless of separator or not. These batteries are going to improve your relationship with the skyrocket and get you through a day of heavy use with out a problem. On the updated stock Android 4.0 these will give you another 4 hours of use compared to OEM. I am using a custom ROM and I get 2 to 3 days on a single charge. That is with bluetooth on, wifi on, GPS on, and screen at 75%. I have not been able to say that I got multiple days on a single charge since I started using a smart phone. I still carry the other battery with me but I never have to use it unless I am seeing just how long I can go on a charge. If you are thinking about spending a little bit of money to greatly improve your device, look no further! The charger that comes with the batteries is almost as great a the batts. You can use it to charge just about any battery. This is great if you have lost that stupid cable that only charges that one thing, like I have countless times. I use the charger for my camera battery, other phone battery, and any random piece of tech I want to revive. The charger can run off an outlet and u can plug another usb cable into it and charge another device at the same time. if you don\\'t have a plug u can use it by inserting a micro usb into the charger and the other end in a laptop of other computer. The charger also doesn\\'t have a set positive or negative so it never really matters how put the battery into it.

I normally have to plug in right around lunch time, not so with this battery & cover kit.  This battery lets me work all day and still have power to spare!This kit will double the thickness of your S3, but given how skinny the phone is, it is hardly a problem.  The included covers fit perfectly.  Overall I am very impressed!\\nWhen I received the battery it had 55% power remaining on the battery. I drained it to 5% and turned off the phone overnight to give it a full charge.  I powered up the phone at 6:30AM.As of 10:30PM here are the usage stats:  Battery life remaining: 25%. Screen \\\\\\\\\"on\\\\\\\\\" time: 5 hours, 42 minutes. I ran the Sirius-XM app for about 60 minutes, downloaded 3 apps, updated 4 apps, played a game for approximately 30 minutes, edited photos for approximately 30 minutes, surfed the web, watched videos for 20 minutes, spent 10 minutes on the phone and sent/received approximately 6 text messages.  My phone is set to sync data real-time, and bluetooth was on approximately 7 hours. I run both Yahoo and Gmail email accounts set to provide real time updates.  All the data was run via wifi and I have disabled 4g since my area doesn\\'t get the best 4g signal.  I run stock android with Apex launcher.Overall, I am impressed with the battery.As a side note, I agree with others that prefer the thickness of the phone with the extended battery. I find it far easier to hold, however the added weight will take some getting used to.  BTW, The provided battery cover fits very well.I puchased both the Qcell case and the Yesoo case. Both cases fit the phone, however the glossy Qcell case is a fingerprint magnet.  The Yesoo case looks and feels great. It reminds me of the Diztronic matte black case in both style and feel.Day 2 - It just keeps going and going...I don\\'t have the specific stats for day 2 because my wife held my phone with the extended battery, liked the feel better and wanted an extended battery and case of her own. I gave her mine.Since we transferred batteries, I don\\'t have the battery stats for the day. I will say that I tried like heck to drain the thing to give it a full charge overnight and had to give up at 11% - it was getting late.  Get this, at 10:00 PM the battery was at 17%.  To try and drainthe battery I ran Co-Pilot with GPS on. I messed around with Co-Pilot running maps and testing voices. To make sure I got the most drain possible I didn\\'t close Co-Pilot, but kept it on in the background. I then played World of Goo for 30 minutes, watched a video on YouTube for 25 minutes (with screen at 100%), surfed the web and went back to the World of Goo for 20 minutes.  By midnight the phone was still at 11%.  Two hours of extreme use and only a 6% drop in battery life.  Amazing.When I purchased this batttery I also purchased the Anker extended battery.  The Anker is now in my phone.  It too fits well with the Yesoo case.  I will see how the Anker compares this weekend.\\nI received my case in the mail 2 days ago and am currently very happy with it. I did a quick test yesterday to see how it holds up compared to the mophie juice pack plus, which I owned for about 3 days before returning it.The test: I first ran my phone\\'s battery all the way until it automatically shut down. Then I turned on the fully charged case by flipping the on/off switch located at the bottom of the case. Over the next 3 hours, the case was able to charge my phone from 5% all the way up to 98% before it completely ran out of juice; during the charging period, I barely used my phone and had shut off all my apps. This was comparable to the time it took the mophie to recharge my phone (about 3-4 hours). Now, I know you may be wondering why this 2200mah case didn\\'t fully charge the iPhone\\'s 1450mah battery. I attribute this to the fact that this battery stores charge at 3.7V, while the charging needs to take place at 5V. This means the battery must expend power to increase the voltage from 3.7V to 5V, thus resulting in the less than 100% charge (I\\'m sure there are other factors, but I\\'m not an expert in this area; these are only my thoughts). Last night, after I depleted the case battery, I timed how long it took to charge completely using the iPad 10W charger, which was about 4 hours (also comparable to the mophie, which took about 4-5 hours with the same charger). Honestly, I don\\'t mind the charge time being so long because I\\'ll probably be sleeping while this happens anyway.Features:The case is sleek and fits snugly around the iphone. The two pieces fit snugly and snap together with a soft \\\\\\\\\"click\\\\\\\\\". It takes some force to remove the top piece, so the case won\\'t accidentally come apart when you try to remove it from your pocket. The material feels slightly rubberized, which is nice because it offers a nice non-slip grip on the iphone without being too clingy on clothes. The dimensions are slightly different than what was listed: 5\\\\\\\\\"L x2.25\\\\\\\\\"W x 0.5\\\\\\\\\"D. The material on the inside is slightly cushy, so it won\\'t scratch the back of the iphone. However, the face of the phone is flush with the edge of the case; there is no extra lip, so you must be careful about putting your phone face down against a table because the screen will touch the table. A screen protector should protect against minor scratches in this case. I have not been able to test how capable this case is when it comes to protecting against falls, and I don\\'t ever plan to. I don\\'t think it will be as protective as a soft shell because it is a hard material and very form fitting.The cut-out for the microphone will fit an apple headphone jack perfectly with little room to spare. This could be a con if you have headphones with a bigger jack.The lock button is a little recessed, so you don\\'t accidentally push it, but it isn\\'t too hard to push when you need to. The silence switch and volume buttons are also slightly recessed, but also easily accessible. People with bigger fingers might find it harder to push though.*MAJOR PRO* The charging port uses the 30 pin adapter provided by Apple! There is no need to carry around another micro usb cable as you would have to with other cases, like mophie\\'s. Also, you can transfer data while the iphone is still in the case, so you don\\'t need to remove it from the case when you want to sync to a computer. A slight con to this is that the cable will connect reversed; the icon on the pin will face down while connected to the case rather than facing up when connected directly to the iphone. This is only a minor nuisance unless you like to dock your phone to an iHome or something similar because your phone will face backwards when docked (this is assuming that the case fits into the iHome dock slot. Also, the port on the case is not centered, which could also provide difficulties while docking).The on/off switch is located on the bottom of the case next to the charging port. It blends in well with the case and is clearly labeled. Note: when you want to charge/sync the iphone via cable, you must turn the switch \\\\\\\\\"on\\\\\\\\\". The case and phone will then charge simultaneously. If the switch is turned \\\\\\\\\"off\\\\\\\\\", then only the case will charge, and the phone will be disconnected (no syncing).The remaining % of the battery is displayed via an LED display on the bottom right side of the case. They are soft blue LEDs which are barely noticeable at night, if at all (the LEDs remain on while charging). There are 3 blue LEDs, labeled 30%, 65%, and 100%. While the case is charging, the LEDs will turn on as the case gets full. The current increment that is charging will be flashing. There is also a 4th LED that is green and red. When the case is full, all 3 blue LEDs will be on and not flashing and the red will change to green. Both red and green will show if the phone and case are charging simultaneously, and the red will turn off once the case is full. The green will also turn on while unplugged if the case is currently charging the phone. Next to the LED display, there is a small silver button that will turn on the LED to show remaining charge when the case isn\\'t plugged in and being charged. The LEDs will remain lit for 5 seconds. However, I\\'m not sure how accurate the display is because while I was testing yesterday, it dropped from 100% to 65% after 2 hours, then completely died an hour later when the juice ran out.There is also a kickstand on the back, but as another reviewer noted, it is really flimsy and wobbly. It seemed so flimsy that I am probably not going to use it because I don\\'t want it to break, which would leave an uncomfortable gap in the back of the case where it used to be.The camera cut out perfectly fits the camera and flash LED. However, be warned that if you take a picture with flash in a dark room, there will be some white-out of the photo because the cut-out isn\\'t big enough (the flashreflects off the case and whitens the photo slightly).Also, if you are an avid video taker, you probably won\\'t get sound while using this case because the cut-outs for the mic and speaker are facing the direction of the screen. That feature is good because it directs the sound out to/from you, but it won\\'t be able to capture much sound coming from the camera side of the phone (built in noise cancelling anyone?). An interesting thing I noted was that if your phone vibrates for whatever reason while you\\'re talking to someone on the phone, the other person will be able to hear it because the case will channel the sound into the mic.I currently am not experiencing any loss in connectivity (3G, wifi, or bluetooth) because of the case either, which is great.I don\\'t have a scale to weigh the case, but it feels like the empty case weighs as much as a naked iPhone, so basically when the case and iphone are assembled, the total weight is double that of just an iPhone.Overall, I am really impressed with this case. It essentially doubles the battery life of the iPhone while looking good, providing protection, and without adding much bulk. The price ($25) is cheaper than that of an apple bumper ($30) and much cheaper than that of a mophie juice pack plus ($100). It also works as well as a mophie (so far!). I\\'m hoping that it will work for a year or more, but I will only be able to tell that with time. If it does break, there is a 6 month replacement policy, but I hope I won\\'t have to use it. I haven\\'t had to deal with customer service yet, so I don\\'t really have a comment about that. As of now, I would definitely recommend this case!I hope this helped anyone who was on the fence about getting this case.Edit: After using the case for a little more time, I noticed that keys, or any hard semi-sharp object, will leave minor scratch marks on the case. It isn\\'t too noticeable because of the matte finishing, but if you\\'re OCD about having a perfect, non-scratched case, this would be something to note.Edit: I have noticed some reviewers mention that there is an echo when using the phone while the case is on. I haven\\'t really noticed this because I almost always use the headset mic when I make calls.\\nOrdered a second battery for my Samsung Galaxy SII, and the first battery was defective.  Would not charge the phone and caused the phone to get hot.  Contacted Seller1on1, and they immediately resonded and sent out a replacement battery as well as postage paid label to return the defective one.  I would recommend this seller.\\nI have only been using this charger for about a week but it seems to work great. I have not had any issue with it taking longer than normal time to charge. The quality seems to be good, it is very small and light weight, this makes it very easy to carry in your computer bag, the prongs fold up out of the way. You can also charge your extra battery and your phone with the charger, it has an USB plug for charging. You can use both at the same time, which makes it really nice if your are traveling and don\\'t have a lot of electrical outlets available. Great product, service and delivery were very good.\\nMy phone kept cutting off after I fully charged it 5 minutes prior. I put it back on the charger and it\\'ll say 75%. I checked my battery and it wasn\\'t flat like a normal battery, it was swollen on both sides and it was a little difficult to close the back piece to my phone. Clearly the contents inside of the battery exploded or what not, due to overcharging or whatever. I ordered a new battery from this side on August 31st 2012 and received it in the mail on September 4th 2012. Shipping was fast as shit coming from New York to VA. I\\'m currently using the new battery right now, without an issue. The anticipation is over, phone is fine, I\\'ve learned my lesson about overcharging batteries. Thanx Amazon & TD Group for the battery,fast shipping, and satisfying this customer. 5 stars, hands down\\nI bought all three extended battery brands available on Amazon ([[ASIN:B0082BYQRC Onite 4500mAh Extended Battery]], [[ASIN:B00757ERD2 QCell Samsung Galaxy SIII X-Life NFC enabled 4200mAh Extended Battery]], and this one). I then did repeatable battery drain tests using a battery logger application and an app called \\'Fast Discharge\\' (wifi, bluetooth, gps, and cpu enabled. no screen, vibrator, or flash) for all three, and the stock battery...from 100% to 5%.The Onite battery and the Hyperion both get 5 hours of runtime on the dot, the QCell 4:30, and stock gets 2:45.The battery lasts 81% longer than stock, and stock is 2100mAh, so I would estimate the battery is roughly 3800mAh (see below for more details).  It also has NFC, and I like the back plate.  It seems flexible enough to absorb shock without breaking, but it looks like others have a different experience.  It is the exact same back plate as the one that comes with the QCell battery.I peeled back the label on the battery and I see that the battery is identified as \\\\\\\\\"SWB495060AR/12F25001.\\\\\\\\\"  Googling the 495060AR will get you some results, but unfortunately details are hard to come by.I also did a test with a CBA-III and the battery was tested at 4223mAh, which is actually above its stated capacity.  The graph is in the customer images.I compared the thickness of the phone with a Galaxy Nexus, and it\\'s only a millimeter or two thicker than the Nexus, so that\\'s a good comparison phone.It has unsurpassed (but matched by Onite) run time, has a decent back plate, and a good price.  I recommend this battery without any reservations.---Update---This is still a good battery, but I found that the Gorilla Gadgets battery actually does surpass this one in runtime.  Depending on the price, it might be a good deal too.\\nI received the battery a week ago, and replaced the OEM battery immediately.  With the OEM battery, I frequently received a low-battery warning - usually before 5 PM (after charging overnight).  And even when I didn\\'t get a warning, the battery icon was always less than half green by the end of the day.  With the QCell battery, the battery icon is always almost-completely-green at the end of the day.  Clearly, the battery life is significantly longer.I have the blue Sprint version of the Galaxy S3, and the blue QCell cover doesn\\'t really match.  But honestly, it\\'s not something you really notice.  I\\'d call it a 1/10th point deduction.\\nIt\\'s a good case it looks and feels amazing , the only thing is that you have to charge the case separately  from the iphone because if you charge them both at the same time the case will not charge, so take the case of and charge them separately this is no problem for me , the case charges the phone fast and It lasts a long time, also charge the case for 4.5 hrs In the instructions or the manual it says nothing about this so I did some research and found out tha\\'s the time it takes for it to fully charge so now you know , overall awesome case, great price and good delivery service.\\nI was discouraged too, reading all these critical reviews. Now I think I got the biggest bargain on Amazon.I bought this package, which sounded pretty good: 3 batteries and a charger for $10 less than a Samsung battery. Although some reviews were cautious or critical, I didn\\'t care if the batteries were crappy and the charger was a piece of junk. I just wanted that an 3-4 hours from time to time, and this kit looked to provide it.What I got was an outstanding bargain. Simply outstanding.The 3 batteries each provided more than 12 hours of power -- on their first charge. Nearly as good as the stock battery that came with the phone for its first few charges. Most batteries increase their capacity after a few charges, so this bodes well.No, they don\\'t have NFC like the stock battery. I have never used any NFC features and don\\'t figure to do so. Do you?The charger is neat and compact. The batteries snap into place quite positively and it lights up to show proper installation. Light turns blue when charge is done. The light is so bright I covered it over with black tape: enough light escapes to do the trick.The charger is clearly a trickle charger. It takes 8 hours more or less to charge a battery. But you now have 3 new batteries -- and your original -- to play with. With four batteries to cycle, you should never be without power.I recommend this package whole-heartedly. One of the best bargains I have ever purchased.UPDATE: On its second charge one of these \\\\\\\\\"crappy\\\\\\\\\" batteries lasted more than 24 hours.UPDATE2: This item has just had its price lowered to $10, making it an even more outstanding bargain.UPDATE3: I paid $16 and thought I got a bargain. I just saw that the price has been reduced to $8.99. This is incredible.\\nI bought the Q-cell 2 battery/charger package about 2 weeks ago, it shipped quickly.  The batteries do indeed have NFC just as the OEM batteries, and I use NFC daily.  They fit exactly as the OEM batteries and seem to have similar battery life.  I can\\'t quantify it, but I don\\'t notice a difference on battery life whether using the original battery or the Qcell, in fact, I usually don\\'t know/remember which battery I have in the phone unless I look.  I would say 2300mAh is probably not accurate, I would say they are probably 2100mAh, same as the stock battery.The charger does take a long time to charge the batteries, about 8 hours from 10% to 100%, but it does charge the batteries completely.  There are no instructions in the package, and they are just in plain boxes.  I did find the the charger LED is purple while charging, and turns blue when the battery is fully charged.  The wall charger has a USB out to allow you to use a usb/micro-usb to charge your phone directly, however based on how long it takes to charge the spare battery in the charger, I haven\\'t tried to charge a phone directly, seems like it would take forever.Overall, I think this is a great value for $25.\\nThe batteries and the external battery charger both work great so far. The batteries are exactly what I was looking for and include NFC. I also own an Anker battery and these QCell batteries have just as good battery life, if not better, and the best part is I don\\'t have to sacrifice NFC with the QCell batteries. The charger brings all of my batteries to 100% as well. The Anker external universal charger only charges the batteries to around 93%.These are the best replacement batteries on the market at the moment.\\nI\\'ve had two previous chargers of the same make, so when I upgraded to the Galaxy S3, I had no reservations about getting another.  Like other AC wall chargers for your phone, they don\\'t charge as quickly as a 12V/car plug.  However, this offers the ability to use a fresh battery and not be tethered to the wall.  It would be a good deal with two batteries, but the third battery in this lot makes it a steal.The stock Samsung battery is 2100mAh with NFC.  These batteries do not have NFC, but they have a slightly larger capacity of 2300mAh.  I\\'ll take capacity over NFC any day of the week, and between the increased capacity and the number of batteries you can keep yourself connected and entertained for a very long time.\\nI\\'ve bought about a dozen of these \\\\\\\\\"fake\\\\\\\\\" OEM apple iPhone chargers over the last few years, and I\\'ve found that a product like this calls for some creative math...First thing to understand is that this is, relatively speaking, not the most reliable product.  For every 4 or 5 of these that you buy, at least one\\'s going to be a dud.  Normally, a 25% failure rate would win you a super-crappy rating, since far more people are likely to complain about a dud than praise a winner.  What makes this situation different is that you can purchase about 5 of these things for what you would pay for a \\\\\\\\\"real\\\\\\\\\" apple charger.Hopefully, you see where this is going... my recommendation to you is roll the dice!  Take that same $30 you were going to spend on one of these at the Apple Store, and get 4 or 5 of the cheap OEM jobbies.  Chances are good that you\\'ll get a dud, or even two.  But that means you\\'ll still have 3 or 4 of them that work just fine. Toss the duds as soon as you test them, and then sit back and enjoy the luxury of being able to stash a charger everyplace you might need one. No more forgetting your charger at home, and being stuck with a dead iPhone.  Now you can put one in your car, your bag, your night stand, your office... no more having to remember to unplug it and take it with you. I got these things stashed all over the place. It\\'s niiice.I know what you\\'re thinking. \\\\\\\\\"But what is a piece of crap like this going to do to my $500 phone?\\\\\\\\\"  Well, I can\\'t speak to every user\\'s experience, but I\\'ve got about 12 data points now, and I\\'ve never had one of these things injure a phone, let along kill it. The worst that a dud seems to do is simply not work.  Sometimes you don\\'t see the little charge symbol on your battery icon, and sometimes you get a scary yellow triangle on the screen with an error message that protests something like, \\\\\\\\\"this is not compatible with your device.\\\\\\\\\" But that\\'s about it. Call that charger a loss, toss it in the trash, and move on to the next one.And while I realize that the thought of such a chancy strategy may not sit well with everyone, consider this: that \\\\\\\\\"real\\\\\\\\\" apple charger probably did cost about 4 or 5 times more to manufacture than the fake charger. Thing is, the real one costs Apple $1 to make in china, and cost you $30 to buy. The fake one costs 20 cents to make in china, and costs you $6 to buy. So... how well does it sit with you that you\\'re paying a 3000 percent markup for the real one?I love you Apple, but NO. You are waaaay over-charging us for your chargers, and I\\'m neither loyal enough nor stupid enough to overlook it. Buying the OEM jobbies might be alittle bit like playing the lottery; but so far, I\\'ve been very pleased with the odds.\\nSo, contrary to the previous review saying this battery does not work. Direction following helps. Allow this battery to charge completely for 12 hours, Following, allow Discharge completely. then repeat 2-3 more times for maximum benefit. I personally purchased this battery even seeing the 1 Star Review because I knew this couldn\\'t be true. So Far After a full 100% charge over night, and use all day, I have no dropped before 85% (I am currently on hour 12 of the day.) This includes Texting, Gaming, App usage, Web usage, and a little music streaming to and from work. My display is set to Auto now, for half the time it was at 100% Display. This Battery so far works GREAT.As for the Design, The problem with a super small phone such as the S3 is the following. You want a small phone + a Long Battery life? You are in the wrong phone market then. If you need a comparison of what this turns into size wise, if a lastest generation iPod is a S3. Then the iPhone 4S is the S3 with an extended battery, in terms of product size. It is not super bulky, and it still is not noticeable in a pocket. Remember, you are going from a battery that at best lasts 27 hours off charger (2100mAh) to a battery that can go almost double that.(4000mAh)I 100% Recommend this battery to anyone who has the Galaxy S3 and is looking to have a reliable extended battery for a cost effective price.I would recommend this product to a friend, & I would purchase again, even at a price tag of 30-40 USD.Hope this helps Clear things up.CONS: It doesn\\'t do my laundry, and it doesn\\'t babysit.\\nAs said in the title, this product is - overall - a great one.With the regular stock cover on the phone, it measures in at at around 0.8cm. With the extended battery cover, it measures in at around 1.4cm. So, with the help of subtraction, the cover itself is a little more than half a centimeter bigger than the stock one. It has a nice feel, arguably sometimes nicer than the thin stock cover because it feels more durable. But I must admit I do wish there were slim 4000mah batteries out there, as extended ones like this one can also feel bulky.The color and finish, as seen in the picture (edit: pictures can be found in photo gallery on item\\'s page), is slightly different than stock. There is no branding. The finish is duller and less reflective, without that horizontal scratchy bar pattern found on the stock one (when you look close enough). The color seems to be a little more gray than the pebble blue found on the stock cover, but it still looks and matches quite well with the rest of the phone.The indents for the LED, camera, and speaker are all designed perfectly and look great. No complaints there.The cover itself, from a physical standpoint, is very sturdy and looks like it\\'ll hold its own for a while. One COMPLAINT is that the cover is relatively difficult to remove from the phone once it is on; however, this seems to be a common issue when it comes to all and any extended battery covers for phones. Why? Because the design makes for it to be less flimsy and flexible, thus making it hard to peel and bend it back when taking it off. To avoid small cumulative damage - as I take off my cover a lot, I am a developer - I suggest using something like a credit card to stick in once you peel it off slightly with your finger as you would normally. Then, simply slide it in there to spread the pressure around so not one point gets too much and builds up damage, and pry. Not a big deal, I\\'m just a little picky. You can, also, just pull back harder than you normally would.UPDATE: The battery came to me at 44% charge and lasted a little less time than the stock at full charge - which was great news. I did follow the instructions as to ensure the initial charge was at least 12 hours (after I drained whatever it came with). My first FULL charge cycle was going on around 38 hours with 6 hours screen on time AND 20% charge remaining. I never finished the full charge as I needed it for the next day, so I plugged it in at that 20% before I was able to drain the entire thing like I was supposed to. However, I would\\'ve guessed 48 hours would\\'ve been my final time. Battery life has been GREAT for me; no complaints here. NOTE: For the majority of the time I was on power saving mode with the first two options checked, as I always am. There isn\\'t a significant performance decrease but there is a significant battery life increase. During the time it was off, I was constantly checking the battery level and it still performed like a champ.\\nI picked up this battery because I\\'m frequently on the go, and I like to be prepared.The Mophie Juice Pack Powerstation Pro feels very solid. The exposed aluminum hasn\\'t shown any signs of scratching while its been tossed around in my messenger bag. The rubber is soft and feels pretty durable. The rubber also isn\\'t a dust magnet.The operation is pretty simple and straight forward - there\\'s only one button on the side. When nothing is plugged in, the button simply lights up the charge indicator LEDs. If an iPhone or another device is plugged in, the button shows the charge level, and then starts to charge the connected device.The Powerstation Pro has an IP-65 Ingress Protection rating. This means that it\\'s completely protected from dust/small solid particles (that\\'s what the 6 means), and it\\'s reasonably water tight (that\\'s the 5 part). The water test means that the unit can survive a water jet sprayed from a 6.3 mm nozzle from any direction for at least 3 minutes (Water volume: 12.5 litres per minute; Pressure: 30 kN/m² at distance of 3m). The product page on the Mophie website shows the Powerstation Pro being completely submerged in water for a short time. Will the unit survive this kind of accident? Probably. But the IP-65 rating suggests that your luck will vary if you take your Powerstation Pro for a swim. Don\\'t submerge it if you can avoid it.The Powerstation Pro has a total internal battery capacity of 6,000 mAh. It can supply enough current for both standard and high-power USB devices (up to 10W). Although the newest iPad comes with a 12W USB power adapter, the 10W current supplied by the Powerstation Pro will not damage the iPad - or any of the latest-generation iOS devices.For reference, here\\'s a list of some popular devices and their battery capacities:ASUS Transformer Infinity TF 700 - 3,380 mAhGoogle Nexus 7 - 4,326 mAhiPhone 5 - 1,440 mAhiPhone 4S - 1,432 mAh.iPad (4th Generation) - 11,560 mAhiPad (3rd Generation) 11,560 mAhiPad 2 - 6,930 mAhiPad (Original) - 6,614 mAhMicrosoft Surface (with Windows RT) - ~4256 mAhSamsung Galaxy S III - 2,100 mAhSamsung Galaxy Nexus - 1,750 mAhSo, you\\'ll get a little less than half a charge on an iPad 3 or iPad 4. I used my Powerstation Pro on a weekend trip with my iPhone 4S, and it lasted for two full overnight charges and two quick mid-day partial recharges - and the Powerstation Pro still had a bit of power left.Bottom line:-An excellent portable battery for adventurous, power-hungry gadgeteers.-It\\'s definitely rugged, but not waterproof. Don\\'t swim with it.-It\\'ll keep your smartphone running for at least one additional day... Probably two or three days.-Your tablet may need two of these for a full recharge.-Expensive, but it\\'s a high-quality product. A worthy choice for Apple fans with discerning taste.(4th Generation) - 11,560 mAhiPad (3rd Generation) 11,560 mAhiPad 2 - 6,930 mAhiPad (Original) - 6,614 mAhMicrosoft Surface (with Windows RT) - ~4256 mAhSamsung Galaxy S III - 2,100 mAhSamsung Galaxy Nexus - 1,750 mAhSo, you\\'ll get a little less than half a charge on an iPad 3 or iPad 4.

A worthy choice for Apple fans with discerning taste.\\nFor my last few phones i bought cheaper batteries and chargers and i always ended up being disappointed. The off brand batteries never powered my phone as long as the original and the more times i charged them the shorter they would actually power my phone. I also broke a couple of the crap chargers that came with the cheap batteries too.With my Galaxy S3 I\\'m using the Techtiles and none of the cheap batteries have NFC, so they weren\\'t an option for me this time around. The original Samsung kit is so much better than the cheap knock off batteries. Not only do they power my phone for as long as the battery that came with my GS3 but the NFC works too. The charger/stand looks and feels high quality and it comes with another micro USB ac adapter.There is a reason the Hyperion and other batteries are cheaper than the real Samsung ones--they suck and dont work as well. Just save yourself the time and headache and buy the real Samsung like i did. You wont be disappointed!\\nSeriously, the title is what every EVO 3D owner\\'s sentiment towards this battery. I\\'m sold. I spent a week researching extended batteries for my EVO 3d since I\\'m a heavy user and with what I consider as light usage, well, my stock battery didn\\'t. I\\'d average 6-8 hours per charge on the stock battery with about 1hr 30 usage on the display and 30 mins talk time, and my phone would leave me high and dry by mid day! I almost pulled the trigger on the Trexcell here on amazon but the reviews indicated a really shoddy product. Luckily, that week my friend got a Laza extended battery for her Rezound and we went to a huge music festival where we used her phone non-stop! Her phone literally had 70% left a whole day later with about 3 hours with the screen on and with our insane camera use! Unbelievable for a smartphone. If not for her I never would have found this battery for the 3d!Anyway, let\\'s get down to it.I\\'m a nitpicker. As for the rear plate fitment, 9/10. The power button isn\\'t recessed away, nor is the volume rocker. They protrude just enough, and in fact, the volume rocker has a more positive feedback than my factory plate, which I felt I had to mash to get it to work! The quality of the plastic almost matches the factory one, though don\\'t expect it to be as fancy as the oem plate. No red accent rings, chrome, or the tiny icons for headphones, power, etc. Despite this, the case still looks quite sleek, is very well textured, and the embossed big \\\\\\\\\"3D\\\\\\\\\" looks quite good!As for the battery, I\\'ll update more with my findings. As of now, I\\'ve been trying HARD to kill the battery. This is the FIRST charge cycle, so these already superb numbers will improve. The battery shipped with exactly 70% according to my phone. I started my stress testing around 50%. I\\'ve been streaming radio over 3g with max speaker volume while running the camera, which also runs the screen constantly at 100% brightness. This. Non stop. It\\'s lost 23% over the course of two hours. By now my OEM battery would be begging for life support. Apparently the most taxing conditions that I can possibly conjure up can\\'t kill this battery quickly enough, and it\\'s not even broken in. Mind = blown.BUY THIS BATTERY.\\nI recently bought this speaker thinking it would be great to take camping, tailgating, boating, etc.  As soon as I unwrapped it I charged it and it STILL hasn\\'t run out of battery.  I like it because I can carry it around the house or leave it on a table and it stays synced to my iPhone.  The OR3 sound quality is great, it actually far exceeded my expectations. Maybe I just haven\\'t had a new Bluetooth device for a while, but it sounds as good or better than any plug-in portable speakers I\\'ve used.  I would highly recommend this product in a heartbeat to anybody looking for a small, portable, or even desktop speaker system.  5+ stars all the way!\\nI purchased this speaker because I was looking for a more affordable alternative to many of the Bluetooth speakers offered by better-known manufacturers. I thought the speaker\\'s shape and design looked pretty sleek and futuristic from the photos, but I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing a speaker from a company I hadn\\'t heard much about. I\\'m happy to say that, after receiving my GOgroove BlueSync OR3, I was able to lay all of those doubts and concerns to rest. This speaker is really cool, and was definitely worth the price. The OR3 is very powerful for its size, and the Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. I carry the OR3 (very compact and lightweight) and my phone around the house, blasting music, just about all day long. The thirty foot range for the Bluetooth signal seems pretty accurate as long as your path is relatively unobstructed. I\\'ve used the unit for at least twelve hours since it arrived and haven\\'t had to charge the battery since the initial charge. Over the weekend, I brought the speaker to a buddy\\'s house for a BBQ. Many of my friends really dug the speaker\\'s design and were pretty impressed with the audio quality and volume coming from such a small unit. The built-in controls for skipping tracks are also pretty convenient. I haven\\'t had any issues or noticed anything I would identify as a weakness so far, but to anyone who purchases this speaker: read the manual! There are only three buttons on the unit, and some of the functions require holding a button down. For example, by holding the power button for several seconds the speaker will enter \\\\\\\\\"pairing mode\\\\\\\\\" where you can pair your Bluetooth device with the speaker. By holding the +/- buttons you can adjust the speaker\\'s volume. Clicking these buttons, however, is how you skip tracks on your phone or mp3 player. All in all, this speaker is well worth the dough. It comes with a nice felt bag, so if you feel like dragging this speaker around (like me) it won\\'t get too scratched up.\\nThe item described was a 5000mAh Solar Power Dual USB External Battery Pack and Charger.It is a charger and a battery pack combo that is versatile and can be used with other than phone devices as long as they are compatible in its power ranges shown below. It came with a half dozen adaptors designed for US - spec sheet says they vary the package by the country of destination.From its specifications sheet, it is actually:An input of DC 5V - 1000mAAn output of DC 5V/2A, 6.5V / 1.5A, 9V / 1.2A, 12V / 1A (Max)It is slightly smaller than my htc Inspire 4g phone. The battery inside is the 5000mAh which is great storage.About the solar array, it came flat so I had to charge it. There were no preparation instructions that said I shouldn\\'t, so I did that with my wife\\'s phone attached. Later I did a couple of other things.First it powered up using my wife\\'s phone (Samsung Galaxy) in about 2 hours. She had about 10% percent charge left. I know this because her powersaver setting kicks in at 10% The Samsung It has a 1200mAh battery but isn\\'t a power hog and its battery life is about 96 hours with moderate (15-20 calls lasting about 3-4 minutes) usage. I charged it using the solar array in bright sunlight.Second I charged my personal Android 4G Inspire with its 1250mAh battery with its 1500mAh Powerskin - in about 4 hours. This phone system was a dead bottom power level and the phone was inside my house so there was no solar power to lessen the time.Third I calculated `If I had started with\\' - a fully charged 5000mAh Battery Pack I would have had about 1050mAh left in the battery pack. When I checked it had 1040mAh of power left. That\\'s excellent since it came fully discharged. The roughly two hours in the sun had fully charged my wife\\'s phone and also had charged itself to about 75%.Fourth I charged my Foretrex 201.Fifth I went ahead and charged the combo solar/battery system fully with the wall plug arrangement (about 70 minutes) till the four blue LED lights were not flashing.  The specifications read 5000mAh, but when I checked it had charged to around 5300mAh\\'s.I am currently charging my old slick eReader. It\\'s also compatible and since the wall charger (I\\'ve been using my laptop\\'s USB port) for it was lost a long time ago I said `What the heck\\\\\\\\\". It\\'s doing fine and I was reading from the eReader right before I started writing this review.\\nJust got this and while I knew I should have charged it up first, I put it right on the phone (white iPhone 4S) which was at 40%.  In one hour and ten minutes it had charged it to a full 100%.  It looks great, has a bit of heft to it but doesn\\'t add a lot of size to the phone - it still fits in my briefcase phone spot (which isn\\'t that big).  It offers better protection than the old case I had on it; it\\'s plastic, but appears well made, and strong.The design is nice: clean white but a dark grey side stripe all along the sides, top and bottom (I\\'d have preferred all white, but it does look nice and probably won\\'t pick up dirt as easily).  The lavender-blue lights at the bottom show the charge capacity and stand out against the dark grey. To check the status when it\\'s not charging, you just press the button on the bottom of the Mophie and it lights up to show its current capacity.It\\'s easy to put on and remove - not a struggle like my regular plain case.The sound is good - I could probably say better - than the iPhone 4S on its own. The little holes on the bottom front do seem to improve the quality of a phone call. I have only tried it twice but was pleased.The photo area on the back has a black rim around it which is to prevent glare from the flash when taking a photo.The cable to charge it (with your laptop via USB) is included. The instructions are in a little black book (the packaging is nicely done) and are in proper English, which is always a plus! They  could have used bigger type than the 6pt they used in the booklet, but at least it\\'s easy to understand.I\\'d highly recommend it if you need a case and/or charger. At the rate it\\'s going I expect the charge to last two days instead of the usual 8 hours, for me.  I\\'ll try to remember to update it when I know how long the charge actually does last.\\nSome years ago, I switched to using my iPhone 4 as my primary travel camera. But between Google Maps, GPS, and the camera, battery life became a real issue and forced me to carry a backup battery for the afternoons and for the times I stay in places without electricity.  After reading favorable comments, I selected the PowerGen to replace my two smaller capacity batteries and hit the road.When I travel, I go light, and I try not to take anything that I think might break or fail.  The PowerGen weighs in at 4.4 ounces. Since it has a smooth \\'pill\\' shape, it doesn\\'t get snagged on anything in a satchel or pocket with other items.  Importantly, it also doesn\\'t have proprietary connectors that are hard to replace in the field.  More than that, it seems to charge virtually any USB powered devices, like a friend\\'s mobile phone.Battery capacity matters, and the PowerGen\\'s 5200mAh is more than 3 times iPhone 4S, which for me translated to about 3 days off-grid. Using the stock Apple cables, the recharge rate is phenomenally fast, seemed about 1% per minute (note that it didn\\'t work with one lower quality aftermarket iPhone/iPad cable).  The PowerGen typically charges all the way to 100%, then shuts off - it doesn\\'t seem to trickle charge after that.  Not really a big deal, since I typically carry the PowerGen everywhere anyway and it\\'s easy to just press the button and start charging again.  I actually found myself using the LED flashlight - it could be brighter, but carrying a dedicated waterproof headlamp isn\\'t a big deal either.After a month of travel and daily use, the lack of any drama confirms that the PowerGen was a great companion device to my iPhone. It really worked when I needed it and didn\\'t weigh me down when I didn\\'t. I would not hesitate to take the PowerGen with me on further travels.  So far, so good - a solid piece of gear!\\nI am a very small adult woman and have very small ears. Most bluetooth headsets do not fit a small person and the quality of sound, for lack of a better phrase, SUCKS!  This one is FANTASTIC! It does not sound like you are on a bluetooth device for either the listener or for me! It holds onto the head so it does not feel like it is going to fall off and it is comfortable!  I have recommended it to many people so far and those that have purchased it love it too! A really good find and amazon has the best price!\\nThe replacement back (supplied) is good quality - the plastic seems much like the original - and it fits nicely. With the battery installed, and the back on, the phone feels good in the hand; as expected, it\\'s a bit heavier, but not annoyingly so.I have had it only for a couple of days, so I can\\'t provide detailed comments about its capacity. Battery Monitor Pro (BMP) tells me that the capacity is 2800mAh (not the advertised 3800 mAh) but to be fair, BMP says that it\\'s not very accurate at first, until it\\'s had a decent time to monitor battery performance; and Hyperion\\'s instructions say that you should take the battery through five full cycles of charge / drain, and I have done this only once so far. So I will complete the 5 cycles, which will not only be good for the battery, it\\'ll also give BMP more time to do its stuff; then, I may come back & edit this review.However, even right now I can tell that the capacity is far better than the stock battery. Put it this way: one reason that I have only been through 1 complete charge/drain cycle is that it\\'s taking so long to drain!!  I drained it Saturday, charged it overnight, took it off charge Sunday 8AM, and now it is Monday 9AM, and I still have about 50% left. Wasn\\'t using it heavily Sunday, but still, my stock battery would be long gone by now.Finally - and very importantly - unlike many replacement batteries, this one is advertised as having Near Field Communications (NFC). I can confirm that it has it, and that it works (just tried Android Beam with a friend\\'s phone - worked perfectly).All in all, I am very happy with the purchase, and you can\\'t beat the price (I paid $14.99).EDIT, 8 days later. After completing the 5 cycles of drain/charge, I\\'ve now used the phone \\\\\\\\\"normally\\\\\\\\\" for several days. After a full day of normal use, I still have about 40-50% battery charge left. And, having been able to obtain information over this longer time period, the battery app that I use (BMP) tells me that the calculated capacity is about 3843 mAh. Can\\'t argue with that. So, final conclusion: great purchase.\\nMy review for the uNu DX-1700 battery case.  For the video-impaired, it is an excellent product and I really enjoy having it!  In this video I go through how it works and my experience with it so far.  I hope you enjoy it!\\nI\\'ve done an extensive research on this product before buying it. I\\'ve also read many feedbacks here.I purchased this item along with Anker\\'s 1700 mAh battery for Droid Incredible.Now, if you do simple math and consider this product to fully supply 5600 mAh to your battery you will see that I\\'m suppose to be able to fully charge my phone  3 times with this charger; 1700+1700+1700=5100 and the charger is still suppose to have 500 mAh left. That\\'s after I fully charge the charger using the AC power adapter.However, when my phone has a few percents of battery left and I connect this charger to it, it takes the charger 2  and at times 3 (out of 4) blue lights to charge up my phone. Be advised that before I do so I fully charge the charger using the power adapter supplied and while it\\'s charging my phone I\\'m NOT using my phone.When my phone discharges almost completely and it\\'s time to charge it up again, the charger wouldn\\'t provide the full charge because it has only 1-2 blue lights left after the previous charge. It doesn\\'t make sense. How come  simple math doesn\\'t apply here? The charger can\\'t even provide 2 full charging cycles. However, it take about 5-6 hours to fully charge it up. I don\\'t understand this.Besides, the charger came with no instructions. I mean, you don\\'t have to have a PhD to figure out how it works, but at least some hints on how this device is suppose to work properly would\\'ve been appreciated.By the time of writing this I have fully discharged the charger twice thinking that maybe it should take a few full (dis)charging cycles in order for it to perform at its advertised (5600mAh) level just like with many phone batteries but again there were no instructions with it so I don\\'t know. Puzzled and disappointed. If someone could give me some hints I\\'d be greatly appreciative.UPDATE, APRIL 13. HTC REZOUND with 1620 mAh battery.Initially I gave this product 2 stars. I am adding 1star for the exceptional service of the seller. They offered me a new replacement and I received it in 2-3 days after they got the bad unit from me.I am adding another star for the usefulness of the product. If it\\'s fully charged (or even if not, as long as it\\'s calibrated!), it can really save you if you\\'re away from the wall charger.I\\'m adding the fifth star because the replacement unit works as explained to me in the comment to my original review. I wasn\\'t aware of the 30% attrition power thing and therefore I didn\\'t know that in reality this backup battery wouldn\\'t provide 3 full charging cycles to my phone battery. However, I still stand behind what I wrote Laptopmate in my email that when people read the product description and see \\\\\\\\\"5600 mAh\\\\\\\\\" hardly anyone would consider that the attrition power factor here would decrease the actual charging capabilities of this battery. Naturally, people would do a simple calculation and assume that a 1700 mAh battery would be charged 3 times with this external battery. Hopefully, people would read everything that I wrote here so that they are not misled.As for Laptopmate, I am still strongly suggesting you to mention the attrition power nuance in your description wherever you\\'re selling your backup batteries at from now on. Don\\'t expect that people would be aware of this technical detail. You will save yourselves a lot of time from having to explain the same thing to each dissatisfied customer (and maybe you\\'ll have less returns that way too!).Other than that, 5 stars.Also, if Laptopmate doesn\\'t mind, I decided to copy-paste their response to another \\\\\\\\\"dissatisfied\\\\\\\\\" customer as it clearly explains the 30% attrition factor.\\\\\\\\\"Sorry to hear that this external battery does not satisfy you. The input from AC or laptop to external batteries is 5v, while the output from external batteries to phones is 5.3v. Boosting from 5v to 5.3v and the external battery itself consumes power (about 30%). Therefore, the actual power that can be used to charge other devices is 70% (5600x70%=3920mah). So, this external battery is supposed to be able to charge a 1700mah battery for two times and a little more.\\\\\\\\\"P.S. Don\\'t forget to fully calibrate the external battery! Discharge it completely and charge it up to the fullest. Repeat this step 4-5 times and only then you\\'ll see the usefulness of this product.\\nI live on my Droid X2 phone.  Charge it overnight and keep it on charger in the car and, when I remember, around the house (I am retired, so no workplace to charge it at).Constant use for phone, text, email and internet - - the Droid doesn\\'t last long when not on the charger despite power saving apps.  So, I have taken to carrying a rechargeable battery pack.My first one was a Radio Shack Enercell.  It was a weak contender.  Fully charged, it could only raise the phone battery 20% (e.g., 50% to 70%). I lived with it, until it died after 8 months (I will have to take that up with Radio Shack, later).Today, I received this unit - - ordered after I read the positive reviews.It came well charged, three out of four bars.  I charged it for three hours, until all four bars lit solid and plugged it into my Droid which was at 40%.  An hour or so later, the Droid was fully charged and, yet, the Anker still showed its four bars.  Of course, I knew that it must have used some power to resuscitate the Droid.However, I immediately plugged it in to my wife\\'s LG Cosmo which was down to its three out of four bars and was due for a charging.  To make this second event even more challenging, I turned on the flashlight function while the phone was charging.Then, I began writing this review.While the phone continues to charge, let me tell you a bit about the included cables and adapters.  There are two cables, a 6 inch and a 24 inch (measurements are nominal) and seven adapters.  The adapters include the male micro that is needed to charge the Anker and, coincidently, the Droid X2.  The other adapters would be useful in charging a plethora of devices. I recognized a male mini adapter, an older Motorola adapter, the adapter that fits my Garmin, a circular input adapter plus others that I did not recognize.The cables and adapters are all white and I assume this is a marketing strategy to match some of theintended devices\\' original wires.  Weird, as the device itself is an attractive shiny Black. I would prefer black cables and adapters, but that does not detract from the unit.I already entered an Amazon order for black cables that do not require adapters.  I selected both 6 inch and 12 inch lengths, which I feel are optimal for my intended mode of use.  I already have numerous examples of any other length(s) I might need on a frequent basis.The supplied cables and adapters, however, will be kept close at hand for those inevitable occasions when family,friends or strangers need an electronic boost for devices other than those using the micro connection. I think I will be the hero quite often! Maybe, at some point in time, I will need them for an oddball device of my own (but, not for my Kindle as it uses the same micro connector).Just under an hour since I started charging the LG (with the flashlight consuming power, as well) and two things happened virtually at the same time:  The LG showed fully charged  The Anker display dropped to only three barsThe flashlight remained bright throughout.I am thrilled with this initial performance.  Extrapolating from these results, I estimate that I could get AT LEAST two complete charges for my Droid (as a retired teacher of mathematics, I love making these sorts of imputed calculations) which would last me 24+ hours of use between tethered charges (in the real world) that would be at least two days assuming the phone was not used in any way while I sleep.Alternatively, I could use the phone normally and as a night clock for a day and a half on a camping trip or during a power failure.Physically, the unit is compact and not unattractive (not that I care).  It seems well built and seems durable.Its only shortcomings, as far as I can see is the horrible insert that serves as an instruction sheet. Good thing that its use is intuitively obvious and relatively trivial (old math explanation for something that you don\\'t want to explain in a proof).Also,there are two variations of this unit on the market with different capacities and designs.  You should investigate all of them and pick the one that seems to meet your projected needs.Five Stars and worth them!!!AFTER THREE MONTHS:WOW!  Continues to amaze, I am never without power.  What more can I say?Had a technical question and customer service provided, not only an answer, but great support.\\nI ordered both the Opteka BP-SC4000 and the XTG Technology Solar Charger, just to compare the two.  I was looking for a compact, lightweight, solar-rechargeable backup power supply for my iPod Touch, satelite GPS unit, and cell phone.  Bottom line: Except for the User Guide, which is practically worthless, I found the Opteka unit to be superior in almost every way to the XTG model; here\\'s why:1. The specs for the Lithium-polymer battery on the Opteka BP-SC4000 claim 4000mAh capacity -almost three times the capacity of the battery on the XTG.2. The maximum solar charge rate for the Opteka is spec\\'d at 250mA - more than twice the 120mA rate specified for the XTG. This should translate into significantly faster recharging of the Opteka\\'s onboard battery for the same amount of draw-down. (Example: If your cell phone, during recharging, draws 1000ma, it will take about 4 hours of direct sun to replace the charge in the Opteka vs approx 8.5 hours for the XTG.)3. The Opteka BP-SC4000 comes with a complete assortment of adapters to accomodate just about any small, USB-rated, battery-powered device.  The XTG came with only a USB-to-mini-USB cord.4. The workmanship on the XTG seems a bit shoddy, with noticeable gaps at the edges of the plastic sealant that coats the solar panel. The Opteka, by comparison, appears sturdy and well made.5. The Opteka weighs about 7oz compared to 5oz for the smaller XTG (significant, perhaps, only to ounce-parsing backpackers like me).  But those two extra ounces appear to translate into significantly better performance that is well worth the weight.6. It took a little over an hour for the fully-charged Opteka to completely charge my iPod Touch. Once the iPod was fully charged, the Opteka showed about half of its capacity remaining - enough to charge another device. (I was unable to test the XTG\\'s battery capacity in this way since I didn\\'t have the proper adapter, but I suspect, given it\\'s smaller specified capacity, that the XTG would barely have enough juice to fully charge even one device.)7. The Opteka has a conspicuous and intuitive LED display on the front that tells when it\\'s charging, when it\\'s discharging (i.e. charging an external device), and, at any given moment, how much charge remains in the onboard battery.  (When charging an external device, you do have to remember to hold down the button for 3 seconds to begin the process.  Also, to check the state of the battery when the unit is idle, press the same button briefly.) The XTG has a display that performs basically the same function, but is on the back of the unit and therefore not in view when the unit is \\\\\\\\\"sunning\\\\\\\\\".8. At $25.07 through Amazon, the Opteka BP-SC4000 is almost $3 cheaper than the XTG - a clear tie-breaker.ect, given it\\'s smaller specified capacity, that the XTG would barely have enough juice to fully charge even one device.)7.

Great for iPhone and Android!\\nThese strips work.  I used to get daily headaches when I had an iPhone 3G.  I put one of these strips on the back, and my headaches went away.  Then, for further testing, when I upgraded to the iPhone 4S (After 3 1/2 Looooonnnng, slow phone processing years) the day I got the 4S, halfway through the day, my headache came back.  I put a strip on it that night, and have not had a headache since.  If you would like a simple test to dramatically demonstrate the harmful effects of the radiation emitted from your cell phone, this is very simple.  You\\'ll need another person for this experiment...  Extend your arm out in front of you, and have your friend push down on your arm near the wrist, while you resist by keeping your arm up.  (Much like a strength test in a doctor\\'s office)  Now, hold the phone up to your head with your other hand (like you are talking on the phone) and repeat the strength test...  Consider yourself warned.  Immediately, as your brain absorbs 90% of the radiation emitted, you immediately lose acute motor skills and strength.  There has also been inarguable evidence that shows this same radiation has harmful reproductive effects on both men, as we hold our phones in our pockets more, and women.  The reproductive health of our grandparents was VASTLY greater than our current generations, there has to be a reason for this.  If you\\'d like to check the studies yourself, please do so.  PARENTS: PLEASE PROTECT YOUR KIDS!  As for signal strength and battery life, I can speak positively to that as well...  In my office building, we have WiFi, before the strip, if you even entered the elevators (we\\'re on the 6th floor) you would lose Wifi connection.  Now, with the strip I will still be connected to WiFi as I get out of the elevator at the ground floor and walk to our parking structure (roughly 50 yards away) I will finally fall off the WiFi signal as I start climbing the stairs in the parking structure.  I have noticed increased battery life as well, as my phone is not working so hard to find/keep the cell tower/Wifi signal...\\nI bought this 1800mAh battery to replace the 1500mAh in my Samsung Epic 4G (sph-d700).  It fits snugly and provides several more hours of juice.  If you are using the original Epic, buy this battery.  You won\\'t be sorry.  In fact, you\\'ll probably love your phone again and can easily postpone an expensive hardware upgrade.  On a weekend with minimal usage, it lasted 2 DAYS and 7 hours.  With moderate to heavy use, I can get through the day without worry.  This is the way it should\\'ve been out of the box.  (Oh and I\\'m running CyanogenMod 7.2, not Touchwiz)\\nEDIT - I\\'ve posted 5 different pictures to help compare thicknesses for anyone who is looking for a comparison!  After picking up the Galaxy Nexus, like most, I was shocked to find how quickly the battery depletes...even with the screen dimmed all the time.  It wasn\\'t even a full 24 hours before I was off and looking for the extended battery.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it not only cost less then I\\'d thought, but was substantially thinner than most extended batteries end up being.  No ugly bulge, no off-colored covers.  In all actuality, you can\\'t even tell you have it.  I will say that I wasn\\'t too impressed to find that the replacement battery was only 250mAh larger than the stock 1850mAh battery.  Even so, at 2100mAh I was still happy to have a longer battery life, even if it was only about 14% more.  The difference in thickness is almost negligible, as you would only notice when holding them next to each other.  However, the difference after installing the battery is hardly, and I mean HARDLY noticeable.  Although the difference is minor, the phone does come with an ever-so-slightly larger cover for the back of the phone, which matches the stock completely when it comes to cosmetics.  Most cases will even fit over the back with the extended battery installed, even many that weren\\'t designed for it.  That should help to further express how small the difference is.  One might ask the question then...why wasn\\'t this offered as the stock battery?  My guess would be to keep the phone slimmed down as much as possible, as it seems to be in head-to-head contention with the thinnest smartphone out there (as of 1/19/12), the Droid Razr.  The other reason seems obvious...profit.  I mean, why wouldn\\'t you want to buy this battery?!  Samsung\\'s not stupid...they know this line of thought too.  Anyhow, quick pros and cons summary for prospect buyers out there:  Pros:  -14% more battery life  -Almost negligible thickness for an extended battery  -Cost is very reasonable  Cons:  -Why wasn\\'t this the original battery?  -Dimensionally, still thicker than OEM  It is what it is...a battery offering a little more power.  From personal use, I\\'ve noticed a difference, but I\\'d only say an extra hour or so...which matches up with the original math of about 14% more power.  Something to keep in mind; doesn\\'t it seem funny how the last hour or so of your phone always seems like when you need it most?  Pick one up!\\nThe biggest problem I found with solar chargers is they never get your phone past 50%, this is the only charger I have found that will take it to 100% in the same amount of time as a wall charger. The battery in the solar unit takes 7 hours to charge plugged in and 12 hours to charge using solar, and it never has any problems keeping up with any of my devises.   I\\'m a hiker and I\\'ll use the GPS on my iPhone 4S to navigate through to wood in the Sierras, and for all of you iPhone 4S users out there you know how short the battery life can be, it actually drops off on average a percent a minute so I needed a heavy duty solar charger. Even with the high power consumption, as long as I stay plugged in my phone never drops below 100%, even at night when I\\'m using the GPS and the rediculiously bright light all nigh long. The light is also amazing, from a 12 hour charge it will run 18 hours and will stay bright the entire night. So to sum it all up, I actually couldn\\'t pull more power than it could put out, it always felt like there was a wall outlet in my tent becouse no matter what I did I couldn\\'t kill the thing! It was well worth every penny spent\\nEnjoy my video review as I showcase the device and its peripherals.  I also show how it charges various devices.  At the end I compare it to the Energizer XP4001.\\nIn a nutshell, this battery will give you a full days worth of battery life, and anyone with a Droid Bionic should buy one. It will make your phone a bit fatter, but I don\\'t mind the extra girth at all, and it makes the phone more comfortable to hold for me. Phone is still pretty light even with extended battery.I was pleased to see that the battery and case certainly look OEM. The sticker has serial numbers and marking that look exactly like my normal OEM battery. Also, the plastic extended battery back panel, looks and feels exactly like the original along with the Verizon, 4G and Google logos. As far as I can tell, this is the real deal OEM.Performance: I received the battery with about 80% charge. I charged the battery to 100%, then I downloaded and installed the \\\\\\\\\"BatteryCalibration\\\\\\\\\" app from the android marketplace. I followed the 4 simple steps.1) Plug your phone to the charger2) Wait till it charges to 100%3) Click \\\\\\\\\"Battery Calibration\\\\\\\\\"4) Unplug your phone.What this app does is wipe your battery stats. It forces the phone to recognize that you have a new and different battery with different capacity. If you don\\'t do this, you will not get optimal battery life out of your new extended battery.After doing Calibration, I allowed the phone to die completely and then charged it again. Under first charge, my phone last just over 24hours. It\\'s a brand new phone for me, so I have been playing with it extensively all day, using 4G mainly, some WiFi, games, pictures, a bit of Navigation, and lots of texting, emailing, browsing, etc.So 24 hours I think was really good. My other battery would die after 9 hours tops of similar use. I\\'m sure if you use the phone moderately throughout the day, you might even get a day and a half of battery life out of it. Most people should have no problem making it through the entire day, and then just charging it at night.\\nPretty good battery pack:  * Very well built  * Battery charge/capacity indicators are very nice looking  * I\\'ve been impressed by how on/off works: Plug-in device you\\'d like to charge, push the button to charge. Unplug the device to stop charging, the battery pack will power off on its own. Easy, nothing extra to worry about.  * Overall design is neat - doesn\\'t diminish the iPhone\\'s look when it\\'s next to it  * The shiny plastic doesn\\'t scratch too easy - I\\'ve been throwing it in my bag and it still looks fine  * Doubling the battery as an LED flashlight is a bonus - double-press the button to turn it on, double-press to turn it off.  * Comes with a bunch of little cable connector tips. This could be a good thing if you don\\'t already have cables but I use my own 22cm short iPhone cable from CableJive and another supershort microUSB cable by Nokia.  * I use any random microUSB charger to charge the battery since I always have those around - not sure if that\\'s recommended but been working fine for me.  I\\'ve used the battery pack to charge my iPhone, T-Mobile Hotspot, Kindle, friends Android phones, and good to know that I can also charge my iPad if needed. Charges the iPhone pretty quick, I can carry both in the pocket since I have the short cable.  Would definitely buy this product again over any other battery pack out there but would also consider the 2900mAh version of it. At the time I was buying, this product had the most capacity in the smallest size - awesome!!\\nI don\\'t normally write too many reviews but I had to write something about the Unu DX-1700. I\\'ve spent a great deal of time doing cross comparisons of different battery cases on the market before I settled on the Unu. There is relatively very little information on the web about the unit so I figured I\\'d help out buyers like me who like to research the item before they commit to buying. So here goes:  The Good:  1. The Unu is attractively priced. Many other battery cases range anywhere from $60 - $80 which is way out of my price range for this type of product.  2. The Unu looks good. I\\'ve got a white iPhone 4 (Verizon) and a majority of the battery cases out there are black. Also, the Unu has a nice, glossy finish which compliments the iPhone.  3. It works. I can go an entire day (13 hours) without recharging my phone, and that includes web surfing, sending/reading emails, and of course playing games.  The Bad:  1. The Unu does add some considerable bulk to your slim iPhone. Both in thickness and in height.  2. The Unu adds extra weight (mainly from the battery) so throwing it in your pockets may be uncomfortable.  Bottomline:  It\\'s a quality battery case that works well, compatible and reliable, and is relatively inexpensive. There are negatives, but they\\'re all superficial. If you\\'re a person who is always on the go and you don\\'t always have time to charge your phone then this case is for you. I\\'ve had my Unu for nearly 4 months, and it has saved me on many occasions, particularly last week when heavy winds knocked down all the electrical lines and our neighborhood had no electricity for 3 days. Outstanding product - gets 8 out of 10 stars from me.\\nI found many extended life batteries for a cheaper price than this one. However, I am a big proponent of you get what you pay for. I chose this one based on other reviews on amazon and internet searches. Additionally, many of the other batteries offered simply looked cheap and untrustworthy whereas this one was much more professional looking. I bought an extended life battery because my Inspire 4G sucks the battery quick, especially when the signal is low or when on the internet. I have had this battery installed for 6 days and have only one complaint; I couldn\\'t get it to drain fast enough to perform the break-in procedure. I have little to no signal in my office and still had to plug my phone in to speakers and play music all day to get it to drain by the end of the day.  When I bought this battery I wasn\\'t expecting to get a full \\\\\\\\\"no charging\\\\\\\\\" day out of it and was pleasantly surprised that most days I do. My OEM battery would normally be dead in 5-6 hours while sitting in my office and now I can go all day, depending on my usage amount. Awesome!!\\nI wanted a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use with my iPhone. I looked online and searched Amazon and it seems that there are not too many options for a portable Bluetooth speaker. I found a couple but they were too expensive or they had bad ratings. I came across this speaker and I figured at $49.99 it\\'s worth a shot. I received the speaker a week ago and it is exactly what I was looking for. The sound is surprisingly loud for a small speaker and you don\\'t sacrifice quality for loudness. It can easily fill up a room and all my friends were pretty impressed. Another cool feature I realized is that I can pair this speaker up with my phone using Bluetooth and use it as speaker phone (the speaker has a built in mic). Also, it comes with a carrying pouch and cables to both charge and to connect the device to any device using a 3.5mm input. Overall, I am very impressed with the speaker, the quality is great and the build is solid. I am thinking of buying a couple of these as Christmas gifts.\\nI use this for my Samsung/Google Nexus 4g Android phone. I can charge my phone and spare battery at the same time from a wall charger. This charger also has a micro usb port. So you can use you micro usb cable to plug into you PC or car USB port.  No instructions though, and i didn\\'t want to plug my battery in the wrong way. I didn\\'t see any positive negative indicators on the charger terminals. So i used a volt meter to see which one is which before i plugged in the battery. If your staring at the face of the charger with the big ANKER logo, the gold terminal on the left is positive  +  and the gold terminal on the right is negative  - ). Look on your battery for polarity markings and plug in your battery appropriately. My battery has 3 terminals, and the middle one should be ignored for charging purposes. I\\'m not to sure what happens if you plug in the battery backwards????? Probably just wont charge, maybe the led on the charger lets you know somethings wrong. I don\\'t feel testing it.\\nThis external battery kept my Samsung Galaxy S 2 with power for 3 movies on a 2 leg flight of 12 hrs and had plenty to spare.  Nice to discover that the ac charger charged both cell phone and external battery at the same time\\nHere are the missing instructions: Try terminals on your battery until you get a red light. Then plug it in and wait until the light turns blue. It automatically figures out which is positive and negative for you.I bought this charger because I got a few batteries for my Nexus S for cheap and didn\\'t want to have to swap them out of the phone to charge them. I\\'ve actually been pretty impressed with this device. It says on the back of it that it can tell which terminals are positive and negative automatically. I was pretty skeptical of this claim until I checked it with my multimeter, and sure enough, the thing automatically figures it out when I put the battery in backwards. After I figured out that the light hints to you how to use it, I thought that the entire thing was really clever.It also charges my batteries fairly fast, so it\\'s probably equally clever about how to charge lithium-ion batteries. All in all, pretty happy with it.\\nI never used it to charge my phone from 35% yet. I have been using it at work around lunch time when the battery level drops to 84%. I am using this portable charger with my Samsung Epic 4G Touch (Samsung Galaxy S II). I call it \\\\\\\\\"The Mighty Mouse Charger\\\\\\\\\" because it is small, very portable but it is powerful at 5600mAH. The price is nice. I showed it to people they thought it cost more than the $49 I paid for it.This portable charger charges at the same rate as the AC charger that comes with the phone. I can take this charger everywhere I go, it can be placed in a pants pocket with a lot of room to spare. The Samsung Epic 4G Touch has a battery life of 12 to 13 for medium use. I am a heavy user, I use the internet, Netflix, play games/music. Netflix alone can drain your phone battery pretty fast if you watch a more for one hour. I am still testing it out. You have to charge it for four to five hours the first time you get it. After that it should last 3 to 4 days before you have to charge it again.This Anker Power Bank charger really comes in handy. I highly recommend it. Oh I had the  New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000mAh External Battery Pack. It is 11,00mAh but it was too bulky too carry around without a backpack. I use to carry it in a hard drive case that had a belt loop. I sold it and got this one.\\nI wanted a stand for my phone because stands make it look fly on my desk so I bought this one.    Just like what the other reviewer has said, this is a SAMSUNG branded charger (it was made by SAMSUNG)    This dock has a compartment for the battery (the thing that pops up in the picture is just the cover not an actual stand)    The place where you put your phone has a little plastic piece that keeps your phone from falling over.    The LED in the back shows red when it\\'s not done charging and green when it\\'s done.    I added a case to my phone to show you that the phone fits with the case that I use which is real nice.  The case I have is this case: [...]\\nCheck out my video review for in depth information but if you want a quickie, then yes, it works! It\\'s a great product at a great bargain. Highly recommended!\\nI bought this battery to perform some experiments with increasing my flying time. This worked great. I now average about 15-16 minutes flying time, and that is just until is starts to get a little weak. I could easily go another couple of minutes, but I don\\'t want to push the batteries that hard, and it\\'s a lot more fun flying with charged batteries.This modification is safe and easy. This is because these cells use safety circuits to limit over discharge and over charge. There are a few precautions though:1. Use two batteries of equal age. This means a new battery in a new heli and a new replacement battery, or two new replacement batteries. Do not mix a new replacement battery with an old, worn out battery.2. Use two batteries of equal charge - preferably discharged. This is not critical, but it is better to start with two discharged batteries so they don\\'t have any significant energy if you accidentally short something. Also, it just keeps everything in better balance from the start.3. Hook up the batteries in parallel - red to red and black to black. This doubles the battery capacity and increases the flying time. If you hook them up in series (end to end), you will double the voltage, which will burn out the motors if it doesn\\'t fry the heli\\'s circuit board (and you won\\'t be able to charge them anyway).This is how you make the modification. First, the new battery is probably fully discharged, so fly your heli until the battery is discharged (unless you are using two new cells). Then splice the new battery in parallel with the battery in the heli. I found it easiest to just cut out the existing battery, leaving about equal lengths of red and black wire. Then I trimmed the wires on the new battery to the same length. I then stripped and tinned all the wire ends. I then soldered the two batteries together, red to red and black to black. Using the double sided tape that held in the old battery, I stuck them together. I then slid some heat shrink over the wires coming from the heli. I then lap soldered the battery wires to the heli wires, red to red and black to black. I then slid up the heat shrink over the solder joint and shrunk it. You could also wrap the wires together and cover them with tape, but that is probably harder in the limited space, and they won\\'t hold as well as solder. Then I removed the weight taped in the nose of the canopy. Finally, you just locate the battery over the battery holder (see photo) and slide on the canopy - it\\'s a snug fit, so there is no need to tape down the battery.With this simple modification, you will double your flying time - or more. Each battery has half the current being drawn from it, so they maintain a higher voltage for a longer time. It\\'s like the first minute or two with a single battery, but for 10-12 minutes. Depending on how hard you fly, even after 14-15 minutes, you can still fly up to the ceiling. After about 15-16 minutes, I start to notice that the heli is losing trim and it is harder to maintain lift. I could easily keep going another couple of minutes, even flying in ground effect, but why push the batteries that hard. The down side is that it would probably take 3 hours to recharge using the USB cable charger. So instead, I\\'m using the wall plug charger that takes about 1.5 hours or less to fully charge the battery. The heli is also a little nose heavy, but I like that, and many people add nose weights anyway. With the heavy nose, you always have forward momentum, and I think it\\'s easier to control. You can also go really fast in the forward direction, but very slow backwards and you can\\'t really hover. You can also add counter weights to the tail (like the weight from the nose) if you don\\'t like it.Some other notes on battery life:1. I estimate that the heli draws about 1.2A to maintain altitude.2. Full throttle draws about 1.5A max with a fully charged battery, but usually about 1.35-1.4A.3. Running the tail motor draws another .2-.25A.4. The LED only draws about 12mA, or only 1% of your average current.So you see, if you just maintain altitude, drift forward, and only turn right and left, you only draw abut 1.2A. But if you are constantly zipping up and down and forward and backward, you are drawing about 1.65A. I\\'m probably somewhere in the middle and I get a good 15-16 minutes. Your results may vary.-Cheersly about 1.35-1.4A.3. Running the tail motor draws another .2-.25A.4. The LED only draws about 12mA, or only 1% of your average current.So you see, if you just maintain altitude, drift forward, and only turn right and left, you only draw abut 1.2A. But if you are constantly zipping up and down and forward and backward, you are drawing about 1.65A. I\\'m probably somewhere in the middle and I get a good 15-16 minutes. Your results may vary.-Cheers\\nFirst off I\\'m not related to the company or any of its products whatsoever.  I\\'m leaving this review because I felt obligated to do so.  I just wanted to share this find and let everybody know that this battery does deliver its promise.  More juice.  I could not believe a battery of the same size could add almost 5 to 6 hours to my cellphone\\'s run time.  And one would think if this is real, why then those multibillion $ companies, like HTC, do not already include this kind of battery to their phones for better specs/sales?  I have no answer to that.  But I tested this and retested it again with same settings and it really does deliver its promise.  Extra juice.  Update (Dec 9,2011) after 4 months of use...  The battery is actually getting better and better.  For some reason it seems like it\\'s now performing even better than when I had just got it.  I am now able to skip a night of recharging if I turnoff my 4g on \\\\\\\\\"almost dead spots\\\\\\\\\".  At work I have an \\\\\\\\\"on and off\\\\\\\\\" 4g and that drains batteries like crazy as we all know.  So I just turn off the 4g there and as soon I step out I turn it back on.  This has enabled me to extend my battery to over a day now.  Also, I experimented back and forth between my stock and anker batteries just to confirm I\\'m not imagining things.  I alternated them for about a week.  My stock would always just barely reach 6pm at night after work.  Always disappointing.  The anker would always outperform the stock by two folds.  I\\'m just so happy with this purchase.\\nAfter looking for a backup battery for my new droid charge, I realized that most of the spare batteries for the charge are actually not the same specs as the battery that came with the phone. Having already had one bad experience (fyi...if you get the wrong battery, the phone will disable charging and shut down certain features) I looked this over very carefully before buying.  THIS IS THE RIGHT BATTERY FOR THE SAMSUNG DROID CHARGE i-510.  When it arrived I compared it and found it was identical to the original that came with the phone. Since using it (I pretty much swap batteries daily) I cannot tell the difference between this one and the original.  It takes and holds charge, lasts as long as the original, which of course varies based on what you are doing with the phone.  Overall, great item for a good value, I will be ordering another.\\nMy cellphone is an older model and gets really hot even after a few minutes.  I felt like my brain was getting fried.  After learning more about EMF radiation dangers and that we are basically microwaving our brains from cellphone exposure, I began searching many EMF shields and protectors. I decided to give this a try because of the price.  The majority of the ones I found online ran between $25 to $65.  I am extremely happy with this.  I often talk for extended periods of time on my cellphone, and this keeps my phone cool the entire time.  I have no idea how it works, but it definitely works. Very effective. Why pay more if you don\\'t have to?\\nWhen I bought my smart phone I didn\\'t realize how much battery power it used. It seemed like I was recharging it every 8 hours  or more. Having an extra battery and this wall charger has made just popping in a charged battery in my phone so simple.  I love that I don\\'t ever run out of power for my phone now!!! Takes about 3-4 hours to fully recharge the battery. If it\\'s red it\\'s charging, blue it is done.\\nI have to admit that I was skeptical about the price of these batteries, considering the Verizon price of $40.00.      Despite my skepticism, I purchased two additional batteries for the Droid X. I was very pleased with the product. I have 2 spare batteries now for my Droid. The batteries appear to be OEM and work perfectly.\\nA review of the \\\\\\\\\"USB Solar Battery Charger for Mobile Cell Phone MP3 MP4\\\\\\\\\", available at Amazon.com    The \\\\\\\\\"USB Solar Battery Charger for Mobile Cell Phone MP3 MP4\\\\\\\\\" ultimately provides a complex foil for contemplating the role of consumer electronics in today\\'s post-industrial economies of symbolic manipulation. How do we characterize the role of the user within the force fields applied by user interface on one hand, and function on the other? From the delightfully poor translation of the English instructions, to the joy I took in having to disassemble and reassemble the wall charger because the circuit board was not connecting with its AC prongs, the unboxing experience left me well prepared to indulge in a phantasmagorically convoluted proposition about the interface of tools relative to their \\\\\\\\\"usefulness\\\\\\\\\" that is the important mark of this solar charger. *Spoiler Alert* What is truly special about this device is best discovered over two full weeks of trying to get it to work. But at the end of your sojourn, it is the near total lack of any actual or practical application for this item - especially toward any kind of battery related \\\\\\\\\"charging\\\\\\\\\" activity - that will amaze and enlighten you, your friends, family and geeky colleagues. *Spoiler over*    Directly out of the box the solar panel causes the lovely green LED to activate. Move it away from the light, the green LED goes dim. Re-expose it to the light and the LED reignites! After discovering this, which as it turns out is the only feature of the charger that actually works as described in the SMANUEL, you are well on your way to entertaining questions about your \\\\\\\\\"perceived need\\\\\\\\\" to charge your various information and infotainment devices using solar energy. The action, aka ontological engagement, really ramps up as you attempt to charge some \\\\\\\\\"actual\\\\\\\\\" items with it. During this time the breathtaking world of hard truths that best describe this device begin to reveal themselves in more depth. The \\\\\\\\\"3 method\\\\\\\\\" presented in the \\\\\\\\\"SOLAR CHARGER USER\\' SMANUEL\\\\\\\\\" are best summarized as: 1) Charge in the sun for 12-14 hours before using one of the many adapters to charge your device. (Personal note, the adapter I needed was not included, forestalling a more complete immediate understanding but forshadowing events to come.) 2) Charge the device with the included AC adapter, and then use the adapter to charge your mobile device. Finally and most importantly: 3) As I will argue is in full conceptual congruence, the \\\\\\\\\"SMANUEL\\\\\\\\\" never really gets around to revealing the mysterious third charging option promised, and further the USB connector, power jack, and green LED similarly yield no clue. This, as you will see, is central to understanding what is really going on here.    Maybe this \\\\\\\\\"third technique\\\\\\\\\" actually works - hell I don\\'t know - but by this point in the experience after totally draining the battery on both test phones (read: actually quite the opposite of what I took to be the devices intended effects), I had actually begun to yearn for a more sophisticated - and I will admit - some kind of more artsy, darkly satisfying, vague conclusion with lots of angst and irony and stuff. After all, returns and the shipping involved are universally understood to be much less satisfying in their function as nostalgia than even the darkest moments of any film major\\'s freshman dirge. The solar charger? It did not disappoint! Users are met head on with a tour-de-force of utter refusal to perform as one might assume, suggesting a highly conceptual and aggressive denial of geek technical pleasure.     Which brings me to the point of asking: Laura Mulvey, where are you when we need you? My psychoanalytic readings of cultural objects have always been a little weak, and I have leaned on you heavily for related analysis of the cinema. But this is user interface. Albeit a limited one, (by my best estimates possesing between one and three degrees of operational freedom), and although the tacit assumptions that such cultural devices index \\\\\\\\\"invite\\\\\\\\\" us to perceive them as \\\\\\\\\"available to us\\\\\\\\\" for some kind of operation that is at least generally congruent to the affordances of the Josef von Sternberg classic Blue Angel, it nevertheless seems necessary to formulate an intellectual framework goes beyond simple voyeurism and scopophilia. UI-pleasure objects demand that the user touch them and accomplish selfish tasks with them, which is quite different from the isolated and constrained situation of the cinema, the \\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\" alone in the dark, with the consequent narrow focus of non-interactive visual attention that is demanded by the cinema. But returning to the main point, another entirely worthless experiment that I tried was to plug the charger into one of the two mobiles I tested it with, and then leave them both in the sun, hoping that the solar panel would directly charge the phone\\'s battery. This turned out to be - of course - just another very cruelly failed side trip that the device both affords and instantiates as its central theme, providing an even more tangible depth to its dismal, minimalist and even existential user experience. Existential you say? Yes, existential in the Heideggerian sense of tool usage and the Dasein as you begin to deeply embrace the ontology of the solar \\\\\\\\\"charger\\\\\\\\\" through its steadfast refusal to \\\\\\\\\"charge.\\\\\\\\\" And if this is not the deeper meaning of the device, then tell me, what is it? Laura, anything left in the tank for us?    The final portion of my UI experience was by far the most surprising, and indeed, strangely uplifting. Feeling \\\\\\\\\"set free\\\\\\\\\" from care or concern for \\\\\\\\\"chargers\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\"charging\\\\\\\\\" and even the \\\\\\\\\"devices\\\\\\\\\" I had intended to \\\\\\\\\"charge\\\\\\\\\" (and also because the green LED was becoming - as all good things eventually do with time - a little less charming), I left it out on a cot in the yard in a final vain attempt to nourish it via solar radiation. Then, I forgot about it entirely and left for the day. And while I was gone, it rained. Uponreturning home, my first thought upon seeing it submerged in an inch or so of fresh rain water, gently spooned as it was in the concave reservoir provided by the tightly knitted nylon of the cot, was this: \\\\\\\\\"Oh no, I ruined my cool brushed aluminum thingy that turns sunlight into a pretty green LED glow. Damn, are the rabbits eating my Pomelo tree bark again?\\\\\\\\\" So, you must imagine my delighted surprise as I drew closer to the cot and discovered that the SOLAR PANEL ILLUMINATES THE GREEN LED EVEN UNDER WATER! This charger is, if nothing else, the most dependable little photon detector I have ever owned. After moments of joyful perseveration (green LED off, turn toward sun, green LED on, turn away from sun, green LED off...), I returned the wet device and all the provided cables and adapters back into to the handsomely designed box - complete with cool magnetic latches btw - and put the complete kit in a safe place where I also hide my vintage 1970s pet rock. This is a keeper. I feel certain that both of treasures will be worth their weight in contemplative value for generations to come, even if one displays a grade of intentionality that the other does not.    In the final analysis: Five stars overall. Battery life, well, I lied a bit here because the single star I gave it nevertheless tends to imply that it is capable of some level of actual device charging. It is not, but zero stars are not an option. Ease of Use: Five Stars, as the pretty green \\\\\\\\\"photons detected\\\\\\\\\" LED lights up even under water, a feature which requires no buttons and is entirely intuitive. (Green LED off, turn toward sun, green LED on, turn away from sun, green LED off...) The important obersvation may be that this charger - in a strictly tabular or logical sense - does not require any actual cognitive effort to utilize, because no amount effort to actuate it will actually suffice, at least under my provisional theory. This is the paradox of the \\\\\\\\\"USB Solar Battery Charger for Mobile Cell Phone MP3MP4\\\\\\\\\", specifically that an appreciation of the deeper waters of its no-feature feature set is in fact so very hard to win.\\nI was delighted to discover these little gems were still offered by Amazon, and at a slightly reduced price from the first one I purchased a year ago.    Back then, when the iPhone 4 was first released, there weren\\'t many \\\\\\\\\"power case\\\\\\\\\" options available.  I found this one, freshly listed by an unknown-to-me seemingly Chinese company and I hesitated.  Long enough for someone else to leave a review. (Thanks Crispin38!)  After all, I frequently haunt the \\\\\\\\\"wholesale direct\\\\\\\\\" websites and the quality often leaves much to be desired.    When that first review arrived and it was positive, that was good enough for me to take a chance and keep my fingers crossed, and am I ever glad I did.    Mechanically, the case fits rock solid.  No gaps or sloppy contact points along the seams, and the snap-together  closure seats firmly into place.  The end result is a trim, slightly thicker than before phone which fits confidently in my grip, with no slippery or \\\\\\\\\"too thin\\\\\\\\\" sensation.  Turned to landscape mode for two-thumbs typing, the size is just right for my large hands to reach any key present.    Electronically, the case delivers pretty much as promised, so long as you explicitly follow the manufacturer\\'s admittedly sparse instructions.  Unu presents this case as a \\\\\\\\\"recharger,\\\\\\\\\" rather than an ongoing power supply, meaning that they recommend turning the device on only after the phones internal battery is depleted. Used in that fashion, the case consistently recharges the phone battery from 20% to 100% every time, though the \\\\\\\\\"power low\\\\\\\\\" warning light starts flashing at around 85% or so.    However, it occurred to me to go against the manufacturer\\'s recommendations and use the case as an alternative power source, thereby saving the iPhone\\'s internal battery from the inevitable charge cycle failure.  After all, $50.00 is a lot less expensive than what Apple charges to replace a failed phone battery.  :)    Thus, I charge the case up each night and it lasts through most of the next day,powering the phone though an \\\\\\\\\"average\\\\\\\\\" day of voice calls, network and cellular surfing, playing music, any number of apps being run, and perhaps a few YouTube videos.  By the end of the day, the low power warning is either blinking or given up altogether, but by then I am home and the phone is more or less docked or corded for the night.  Remember that this kind of usage is *opposite* the manufacturer\\'s suggested application and your mileage may vary, not to mention probably being contrary to it\\'s warranty.  For me, I have no problem with that because a year after having purchased the iPhone 4, it\\'s internal battery is still capable of delivering a charge time comparable to when it was brand new.    As specified, syncing and simultaneous charging work without incident or effort, and I\\'ve never had an occasion where an OS upgrade failed simply because I synced through the case, unlike the failures I am sure to get using certain third party cables.    As a bonus, and an additional reason I am so glad to see them still available is the flat top, bottom, and sides of the case\\'s styling.  This allows me to use the phone with any of the clinometer or \\\\\\\\\"carpenter\\'s level\\\\\\\\\" type apps and never have to take the phone from its protective case.  In fact, the \\\\\\\\\"softened square\\\\\\\\\" style of the case, and its ability to charge the phone when connected to a portable power source (the [[ASIN:B00439G3WS i.Sound Portable Power Max with 16,000 mAh for iPod, iPad, iPad2, iPhone, Droid, and Blackberry]] in this case) allowed me to build the old case directly into a self-powered video tripod system which allows me to literally shoot all day long without interruption.    If you\\'re on the fence about this baby, because of the poorer reviews or just because you\\'ve never heard of Unu, jump down, read the instructions, and grab it anyway.  There really IS an on/off switch and it works flawlessly.  Plus, if you happen to be unlucky enough to get the inevitable \\\\\\\\\"lemon\\\\\\\\\" inherent with any mass produced appliance, Amazon\\'s refund/exchange policy works, and this jewel is worth the extra effort to exchange it and get a good one.  :)\\nI bought the HTC Thunderbolt, and found out quickly the stock battery that comes with it is just pointless. The battery can\\'t make it through 4 hours without the need to be charged. I bought an extended slim which made it through the day, but had issues during the week. One day, it would stay charged pretty good, and the next, by the time I started my route at 9 a.m., the battery would say 95 percent, and by 12 noon, down to 27 percent. So, after checking around on Amazon, I found the HTC extended battery. Ridiculous battery life!!!!!! Cracked it open the morning it came in. The readout was 27 percent. After a full day of phone calls from customers on my route, using the internet, playing my roms at lunch, and just taking random texts from friends and customers, the battery still stayed at 27 percent. Incredible!! Do yourself a favor. If you get the Thunderbolt, just go ahead and get the extended battery. You won\\'t be sorry. I charged it on Monday night, and didn\\'t charge it again until Thursday night after i got off work. After 2 days, it was down to about 56 percent! Worth every penny! Not just sayin that. I drive for a living, and dont have the time to stop and charge my phone. So, this helped me out so much. Just buy the battery. Save yourself the headache.\\nI found myself needing to charge my new Droid X2 prior to the end of the day on a regular basis. I ordered this battery, and am very pleased. It it a tad bigger than the original, but I had no problems using my original battery cover. The other reviews I read made it seem like a replacement battery door comes with it. It does not. Some people reported the battery door being too tight, however, I found that although it is tighter than with the BH5X battery, it works fine and doesn\\'t seem that it will have any adverse effect on the phone. The increase in battery life is fantastic. It actually makes me wonder if there was something wrong with my stock battery, considering this is really just a 20% increase.     Keep in mind folks, you\\'re just adding a little juice. If you\\'re hitting low battery by lunch time, this is not your battery. If you\\'re hitting low battery by dinner time and want just a couple more hours. This is the product for you. Enjoy!\\nThis case is nearly perfect.Pros* More than doubles the battery life (essential if you play games (Angry Birds, Uno, etc) that are power drains).* Protects your iPhone 4 from damage if dropped* Adds minimal bulk. I\\'ve tried other battery cases (including one with a cool \\\\\\\\\"kickstand\\\\\\\\\" for watching videos on planes and such) that turns the sleek iPhone 4 into a 1998-reminiscent brick).* Syncs with iTunes and iPhoto automatically when you plug in the USB to your computer. This also charges it - both the case and the iPhone. You never need remove the iPhone from the case to charge and sync.* Fits ANY iPhone 4 from either AT&T or Verizon* Cost: AMAZING value. It\\'s better than any other battery-case for iPhone 4 and yet it is the most affordable.Cons (only a small one)* Doesn\\'t come with a little plug attachment that would let you charge directly into a wall socket (but the ones from Apple and for any USB device are compatible). So you must plug it into your computer to charge if you don\\'t have one.I\\'ve had iPhones since the day they came out in 2007 and the battery life tended to get shorter and shorter with each passing generation. I travel for work a bit and en route play a lot of games (Angry Birds, Uno) and also watch movies (two uses that really drain the battery fast).I also tend to drop my phone a lot. iPhone 4\\'s are very delicate, with their sharp edges and glass display. I knew I\\'d soon drop it and it would either shatter or one of the edges would get marred (and I hate when that happens).To recap: The Lenmar Battery Powered Case for Apple iPhone was the perfect solution for my needs:1) Battery extension2) Protection3) Minimal bulk4) Ability to sync and charge without removing the phone from the case5) Cost: AMAZING value and better than products more than double the priceTwo thumbs up for this product.\\nThe XTG-SLRBC solar battery charger is a BARGAIN at only $25!  It gains a star simply in versatility to use any AA or AAA battery to charge a device (phone) in an emergency.  HOWever, it is a *cheap* charger, so do not get any high expectations (the \\\\\\\\\"price\\\\\\\\\")!  If you have the money there are a number of expensive quality units, but the cost vs value of this unit put it at least on par with those those expensive ones.    PROS:  Can use any rechargeable AA or AAA battery, easy to replace wore out batteries...  ... Charging of batteries can be done solar or by plugging into an USB port.  Can use regular alkaline batteries to charge cell phone, iPad, whatever.  Built in tester.  Reverse polarity protection (reversed installed batteries not charged).    CONS:  The solar cells needs over 26 hours to full charge a 4 set of AA batteries (2000mAh each, 8000 total) under full sun (small collecting area, not best solar cells)  No indicator for charged batteries (LED only shows it is charging, not very useful)  Tester only accurate for Alkaline (voltage 1.5 to 1.6V, while rechargeable is 1.3 to 1.4)  Plastic will distort on a cars dashboard (outside air OK, not in car).  Easy to scratch/mar the finish.  No handy charge estimate on the charger (it is on the packaging)      Again, the COST vs VALUE is excellent simply because compared to most other solar chargers the versatility of this one blows them away.  Yes, it is full of flaws, but to make a better one would cost twice as much, to gain about 50% better performance.  Under the hood (took it apart) I was impressed with the engineering.  A bit crude, but does the job.  It has 2 IC chips, an LM324 (Presume for charging batteries) and a SC46166 (high efficiency, and low voltage   step-up DC/DC converter, presumably for USB output).  My main gripe is the red LED, because it uses what little power from sun to light it up, best not install it.  OH, and I would prefer for the USB connections on the other side (under the hinge).  Allin all an impressive package for $25.\\nAs part of my long-term goal of living off the energy grid, I decided to get my feet wet with a small, inexpensive solar power charger for my iPhone and other small electronics. My Solar ReStore solar battery pack turned out to be a great way to get started using free energy from the sun.Priced around $30, my Solar ReStore unit arrived swiftly in a white plastic bubble-pack mailer. The package is made of that rigid clear plastic that you need scissors to open and can give you a deep \\'paper\\' cut if you are not careful. I cut off the top of the plastic with kitchen shears and carefully made a cut down the side to pull out the materials.The charging unit itself is almost exactly the size of my iPhone, being a tiny bit larger and considerably lighter. The front consists of a solar panel. The sides offer a USB port, an AC charging port, an LED light on a long, flexible stem that wraps around the side of the unit, an LED light button and a charging indicator light. The back of the unit has a press button indicator showing how charged the unit\\'s battery is - 20, 50, 80 and 100%.My solar charger arrived 50% charged from the sun, which is apparently as much of a charge as the unit can get from solar power only. I hooked the unit to a wall outlet with the included AC adapter and waited around an hour to see the charge total listed as a full 100%.From this point I connected my iPhone, which was down to a 20% charge, to the unit to see how long the stored energy in the charger would take to top up. It was a simple matter to plug my iPhone cord right into the USB port on the charger. At that point I clicked the sliding switch to \\\\\\\\\"on\\\\\\\\\" and waited. After two hours my phone was 100% charged. It only took an hour to bring me to a 50% charge, for reference. I disconnected the charger and plugged it back into the wall to get back to a 100% charge.PROSSince the charger has both a solar panel for energy charging and a battery to hold the energy, I am pleased that I can run my phone indefinitely off the power of the sun. While running the unit purely with solar has limitations (ie - you can only charge the charger to the 50% mark), I can easily work around those limits by paying attention to my use and charging habits. The price was excellent, I was pleased with the thoughtful accessories included, the LED light runs for 20 hours off a single charge, and I can be confident to have a working iPhone no matter when/where I go.Besides charging my phone, I can also charge other electronics like a Kindle, Nook, a GPS unit or any USB-connectable handheld device.There are three ways to charge the charger - using the sun, using an AC cord (included), or by using a USB cord (also included) to take energy from your laptop or other fully-powered electronic item. This is convenient versatility.Since I do a lot of camping and RV boondocking, I anticipate getting a lot of use from my Solar ReStore charger. I would also use this for overseas traveling, long car drives, cruise ship trips (any boating really), and in emergency situations when the power is down or unaccessible.The two included window suction cups are useful for charging the unit in car or home windows.The LED light is plenty to read by at night, or cook with, or provide enough low lighting to find your way around camp or a dark house. The flexible stem makes it easy to direct light where you want it.I like the included cloth protective bag. It protects the solar panel when sliding around in my purse! It also lets my fingers know that I am not grabbing my phone, since they are the same size and configuration.CONSThe unit does NOT have a clip, grommet hole or any way to attach itself to the outside of a backpack. Many units like this do come with some kind of attachment point you can clip a carabiner or bungie cord to. My solution is to place the solar panel facing out in a freezer strength Ziplock bag and duct tape the edges of the bag to the outside of my pack. It takes six hours to charge the unit (and again, only to 50% using the sun\\'s energy), so you do have to make sure the panel receives as much light as possible. What\\'s nice is that it does not have to receive direct solar light to charge - although direct light does help speed things up.I would still rather see an upgrade of this unit have some kind of attachment point for clipping purposes.A car-charging (cigarette lighter outlet) is not included, which would have been a thoughtful charging option for auto travelers on overcast days or at night.The Solar ReStore charger is not designed to be used while charging. In other words, you can\\'t sit in the sun and run your phone while it is charging in a continuous manner. You either charge the unit or suck the charge from the unit.I was aware of this point when I bought it, but it\\'s worth noting here. For the price, it\\'s an outstanding charger. To buy an active solar electronics charger you need to step up into the $300-$500 price range and look at \\'sherpa\\' type models.You have to remember to turn the button off and on when charging your phone. It won\\'t automatically start charging your phone once plugged in, and you have to also remember to turn the charger officially OFF once charging is complete, unless you wish to run the battery completely dry.OVERALLAltogether, from my research this is the best quality small electronic solar unit available for an entry-level price. I\\'m very pleased with the quality and performance of the Solar ReStore, the LED light is worth having for the price alone, and the accessory kit is thoughtfully assembled. Well recommended.lace the solar panel facing out in a freezer strength Ziplock bag and duct tape the edges of the bag to the outside of my pack.

Well recommended.\\nI purchased two of these BH5X batteries from seller ACC Stop at Amazon.com. Both batteries seemed to be a genuine Motorola battery with an authentic holographic label and are rated for a 1500/1540 (min/typ) mAh capacity. However, I\\'m not sure that they were really \\\\\\\\\"new\\\\\\\\\" as claimed by the seller because: (1) the contacts seemed to indicate that the batteries had been used, and (2) one battery arrived with a 60% charge while the other arrived fully drained (0% charge).Is this important? Some sellers would like you to believe that it is not but this is patently false. Lithium Ion batteries have a limited life. Three things cause them to deteriorate: (1) recharge cycles, (2) age, and (3) heat.Li-ion batteries can be recharged from 400 to 1200 times as long as they are not subjected to too much heat. Some manufacturers claim their Li-ion batteries can be cycled more than 1200 times but this is usually wishfull thinking under \\\\\\\\\"optimum\\\\\\\\\" conditions---500 cycles is probably more typical. If you buy used batteries, they may still perform \\\\\\\\\"like new\\\\\\\\\" but they may have lost half of their life or more, depending on how many times they\\'ve been charged. This means that there is definitely value in getting a new battery instead of a used one.Even if they are not cycled often, Li-ion batteries will naturally deteriorate with age---this is true even if they are left on the shelf and never used. One of the batteries I received was dated 03-Nov-2010. The other was dated 04-Nov-2010. So they were about 5 months old when I received them. This should be fine. By the way, I purchased my Droid X in early March 2011 and the battery that came with it is dated 27-Dec-2010.The greatest \\\\\\\\\"enemy\\\\\\\\\" of Li-ion batteries is heat. It will reduce their life faster than anything else. This is yet another reason why a new battery is better because you never know how much heat a used battery has been exposed to.Both of the batteries I received tested well. I tested their recharge rate from 0% to 100% and both batteries charged at a normal rate (approximately 10% per 13 minutes). One battery reached a full (100%) charge in 2 hours 9 minutes and the other reached full charge in 2 hours 17 minutes. This test was done in my Droid X using the stock Motorola AC charging adapter with the phone turned off. I plotted their rate of charge during the test and they matched a known good battery. I also monitored their temperature and they remained cool during charging.Here\\'s the charging rate of one of the batteries:0%  -  start charging5%  -  2 min10%  -  7 min15%  -  6 min20%  -  6 min30%  - 11 min40%  - 12 min50%  - 13 min60%  - 13 min70%  - 12 min80%  - 12 min90%  - 14 min100% - 21 min-----------------------------Total Time: 2 hours 9 minutesMy test of their discharge rate was a bit more subjective: I turned off the display \\\\\\\\\"screen timeout\\\\\\\\\" and played a video until the phone died. Both batteries seemed to last about the same time as my original battery.Overall, I\\'m happy with the batteries I received from seller ACC Stop---even if they are used, their price was less than 1/4 the price of new batteries from Verizon or Motorola. However, I wish there was a way to confirm whether the seller\\'s claim of \\\\\\\\\"new\\\\\\\\\" is true. There are many sellers who are selling rejects and heavily used batteries while claiming they are \\\\\\\\\"like new\\\\\\\\\" which makes it difficult on us buyers.The only negative I can cite was the shipping package. ACC Stop shipped both batteries in a single cardboard envelope with no padding of any kind. I would have preferred them to have been padded---fortunately, they arrived okay.I have no experience with other sellers of these batteries but I\\'ve read of many problems. So if you are not buying your batteries from a reputable source, then you are taking a chance.<br/>I hope my comments are helpful.\\nAt the end of the day I\\'m able to bring my Iphone 4, Ipod shuffle & Kindle 3 back to 100% and still have enough power to use the light for about 2 hours.  As another reviwer pointed out having a way to attach the charger to a backpack would be nice, for the moment I use a ziplock bag and a safty pin to attach it and keep it weather tight while walking.\\nI love this case. It was exactly what I was looking for. I do a lot of travel and I always kill the battery every day.This fixes all of that.\\nI was hesitant to try this knockoff batt case... but trusted the other review on here.  It is very sturdily built and provides lots of boost.  I love the sync passthrough that is only available on the cases that cost double and not on other alternatives.  The only two drawbacks I\\'ve found are the added weight/bulk (duh.. to be expected) and you cannot use the camera with flash at night inside this case.  It reflects off the white and blurs out the picture.  Really not a deal breaker for me.      I cannot suggest this case enough as an alternative to the higher priced cases.  Love it for the weekends when I am not around power all the time.  This case holds my VZW iPhone 4 at 100% for at least 24 hours with heavy usage... plus then I have a full iPhone batt after that!    9/10  :)\\nI recently purchased the Verizon iPhone 4 and had been looking at all of my \\\\\\\\\"extended battery\\\\\\\\\" options for weeks and finally decided to get this one.  I was initially going to get one of the more expensive extended battery cases, but I thought that since I don\\'t travel THAT often, I didn\\'t want to add the bulk to my phone for everyday use.  I use my iPhone on planes to watch movies, play games and listen to music and podcasts and having some extra power with me is great for longer flights.  I\\'ll always be able to get off the plane with a full phone battery.    I decided I wanted to see how it would perform so I ran my own little experiment and here are the results:    :: Day 1 ::    I exhausted the iPhone 4 battery by streaming video until the iPhone shut itself down  I connected the fully charged Mobile Power Pack  In about 10 minutes the iPhone was charged enough to power back on (5%)  After 2 hours of charging iPhone had 73% charge;  at 2h 40m iPhone showing 92% battery  at 3hrs iPhone showing 95% battery  within 3hrs 20min full 100% battery on iPhone  several hours later the mobile power pack still shows as having \\\\\\\\\"High\\\\\\\\\" charge available    :: Day 2 ::    I exhausted the iPhone 4 battery again by streaming video  I plugged iPhone into mobile power pack (I did NOT recharge mobile power pack; the pack briefly showed High charge and dropped to Medium in a few seconds)  6 minutes into charging, the iPhone powered up showing 4% battery  15 minutes into charging, the iPhone showed 11% battery  40 minutes into charging, the iPhone showed 26% battery  1 hour and 30 minutes into charging, the iPhone showed 55% battery  3 hours and 20 minutes into charging, the iPhone showed 100% battery (Same as Day 1)    :: Day 3 ::    Normal use of my iPhone brought it down to 76% battery.  I plugged it into the mobile power pack which still showed medium charge.  When I looked about an hour later, the iPhone was at 94% charge and the mobile power pack had been depleted.    Rechargingthe Mobile Power Pack  Plugged MPP into wall outlet after being completely depleted by prior testing.  LED indicators lit up in succession indicating charging in progress.  1 hour and 20 minutes from charging start the MPP was showing low light solid; still charging.  2 hours and 20 minutes from charging start the MPP still showing low light solid; still charging.  4 hours from charging start MPP showing medium light solid; still charging.  6 hours from charging start the MPP showing full charge, lights stopped flashing. (May have been done sooner.)    (NOTE: The manual states that Low indicator means 1-20% charge remains; Medium means 20-80% and High means 80-100%. It would be much more helpful if it was 0-33%, 34-66% and 67%-100%, but it\\'s not THAT big a deal)    Conclusion: A fully charged Moblie Power Pack has TWO full charges (with a little left over) for iPhone 4 before having to recharge the mobile power pack and you can easily get the MPP recharged during a standard workday or overnight while sleeping.\\nI had recently dropped my Droid X at work into a bilge with about 4 inches of water. The phone ended up being submerged for about a good 5+ minutes before I was able to fish it out. After retrieving it I pulled it apart and let it dry for the next 3 days. I was happy when I put the battery back into it and everything seemed to function correctly. My problem arose when I tried charging my phone through its micro usb port, apparently I had fried it. I didn\\'t have insurance on my phone so my only options were to pay full price for a new one or find a way to charge my battery externally. I gave this charger a shot when I ran across it here on Amazon, there were no other chargers that would fit the Droid X battery and this one claimed to be universal. When I got it in the mail it took me longer to open the packaging than it did to get the battery charging. It is very simple to use, at the top of the charger there are a couple pins that you line up with the contacts on the battery until the charger lights up. Once it lights up your golden, just plug it in and when the light turns blue your good to go. It took about 2.5 to 3 hours to charge my battery from a dead state to 100%, I was a very happy camper. The charger has a little lip that appears to be spring loaded and holds the battery firmly in place while charging. The charger showed no signs of overheating and was cool to the touch. I have only charged my DX battery with it but it looks like it could handle a wide range of different battery types and sizes. I would highly recommend this charger to anyone who has had similar problems as myself or to anyone who likes to carry a spare battery with them. I give this bad boy 5 stars.\\nI am super picky and I love this case for my pampered iphone 4.  Before I even get to the actual use of the battery, let me start by saying the fit and finish on this case is just superb.  It fits so seamlessly over the iphone that the Juice Pack and the iphone together just seem like one unit.  It really does not make the phone that heavy either in my view.      As for the battery, if you use the phone a good bit during the day surfing the internet, texting, watching youtube, etc., this this is your new case.  The iphone 4 battery is far superior than the one on the iphone 3g.  I am not sure if the Mophie Juice Pack doubles the iphone 4 battery, but it might come close.  I can go all day and into the evening now with HEAVY iphone usage and I do not even come close to running out of power.  I am very pleased with this product.  The LED battery indicator on the Juice Pack looks pretty cool too.    As for Amazon, I did the free Super Saver shipping and still received the Mophie Juice Pack in just a few days.\\nWell, as of November I can say they are shipping 1500mAH batteries identical in every way to the original, down to the Part no.: 35H00123-22m.  Looking at 3 of \\'em and can\\'t tell which one came with phone (other than the numbers I wrote in perm marker to keep track).\\nIf you\\'re on the fence about this case... just buy it. I had the mophie and the mili battery case for the Iphone 4... but they both sucked compared to this case. This case wont scratch like those others due to the soft touch of the case. It lasts longer and is soooo much cheaper. It will recharge your iphone 4 about 75% of the way back. I know it says 1700mAh but the mili and mophie are like 1500mAh and will only give you about 40-60% recharger... so this case is defiantly better in terms of power. The feel is great! The only problem and it\\'s not really a problem is the case is not really really snug... I mean you can\\'t tell if you look at it and it doesnt slide around in the case but you could defiantly have a protective film on the iphone and still get it in the case.... I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER! I would buy it again 10x over.\\nI totally love my evo but the one disappoint WAS the battery life until I purchased this battery...I use my evo heavily and I mean I\\'m on the net alot, bluetooth both for calls and playing music via car stereo, streaming media, texting and calling. my stock battery would only last me 2 hours, like I said I\\'m a heavy user. I got this battery and fully charged it and used it pretty much non stop. I took it off the charger at 9am and when about my day and around 11am I started heavily using it....streamed radio for about an hour and then streamed a two hour movie, texting, downloading apps via wifi, tethered my connection,...and it is now 4pm and it just got down in the yellow..still not dead...like i said, before my phone would\\'ve been in the red by the 2nd hour...7 hours now of heavy usage and it just barely in the yellow. This battery is completely worth it, it gives the evo the fifth start it was missing!!\\nI ordered two of these batteries and I have to say I couldn\\'t be more pleased. I had considered the Seidio 3500 battery, but I really hated the look of it. The back hump was just too ugly and wasn\\'t worth it to me to carry around an ugly phone for a bigger battery.This company doesn\\'t lie when they say they are quick shippers and ship fast! I ordered each one a day apart and each one took a mere 3 days after ordering to arrive. That\\'s amazingly fast for a Marketplace merchant, and wasn\\'t using any expedited shipping company. And the shipping was pretty inexpensive considering the amounts for shipping I\\'ve seen others try to charge.The pictures of this one seriously do not do it justice. It doesn\\'t have a hump, but has a very sleek, attractive look. The thicker part where the battery sits is flat, and gently slopes down to the top and bottom edges. The camera and LEDs are framed by an inset frame, so to speak, that sits lower than the rest of the case, as does the kickstand access. Overall, it really doesn\\'t add much bulk and, better yet, doesn\\'t LOOK like it adds much bulk. The back almost feels like metal, and has a smooth coating that feels almost rubberized. Definitely not slick or slippery, its very easy to keep a light grip on. And a bonus is that both my son (who I got the second one for) and I have white Evos, so with the black backing, we now have Oreo Evos. :DAs far as the battery itself, I haven\\'t had much of a chance to test it yet since I just got it yesterday. But it came with a 70% charge and I was away from home for several hours and used it non-stop, and by the time I got home, it was at 58%. I was accessing the forum through Tapatalk, checking 4 emails every 15 minutes, checking in on Foursquare and Yelp several times, used the browser to search for some information for about half an hour, texted almost non-stop, and several other things. I had background and auto sync both on, and for much of the time was in a building where I was constantly losing 3G signal and when I did get it, it was rather weak. So overall, I think it held up pretty well.I\\'m very happy that I went ahead and purchased this one. Not only was it cheaper than the Seidio (actually it was the same price as the Seidio 1750, which I had ordered a couple of days before for my son and immediately returned unopened when it came).The downside, of course, is that there aren\\'t any cases available for it. However, there are some workarounds, so to speak. I have the Seidio Active case and while the hard shell back obviously won\\'t fit, the inner rubber lining does. So it will have some protection. In addition, I have the Seidio Active holster. I was hoping the thickness of the new battery/back would make up for the thickness of the Active case, and that the holster would still work. I was right and wrong. The holster does not work with the extended battery when nekkid, but with the Active rubber lining on it, it *does* fit. Woot! :)Unfortunately for my son, he has the Seidio Innocase Surface II, and the case doesn\\'t fit. It does fit in the Surface II holster, sort of. It wobbles a bit, there\\'s a bit of spare room, but it holds it securely enough that the phone won\\'t fall out. (I hope he\\'s right about that.)So for those of you who, like me, hate the hump on the Seidio extended battery but want longer battery life without having to carry a spare, you should give this one some consideration. It adds just a small bit of size to it and not a whole lot of extra heft, and it looks very sleek and attractive.\\nThe IMP1000 is the second NEW Trent battery pack I\\'ve owned and used. I\\'ve used (and reviewed) the previous model (IMP880) for several months now. This review will be written from the perspective of comparison of these two models.    Pros:    1. Capacity... 11000 mAh is simply enormous, and provides \\\\\\\\\"charge it and forget it for at least a week\\\\\\\\\" use for any purpose I can foresee. I\\'ve been running the IMP1000 on its initial charge for a week now (usage details in \\\\\\\\\"review section\\\\\\\\\", below) and have just gone from medium to low on the capacity LED\\'s.  2. Finish/durability... I noted in my review of the IMP880 that the rubberized coating was not durable; even though I handled it carefully, it was worn away easily (particularly at the pack\\'s edges). The hard, glossy, color-molded-in finish of the IMP1000 should fare much better. Time will tell, but so far, so good.  3. Ease of use... No \\\\\\\\\"long press vs. short press\\\\\\\\\" power button functions. I haven\\'t had any trouble using the IMP880, but simpler is nearly always better (something Apple does very well, and NEW Trent targets Apple customers, so this is a good fit).  4. Accessories... The retractable USB cable seems more robust than the one included with the IMP880. I haven\\'t had the same problem with the microUSB connector slipping into its rubber shell that I wrote about with the IMP880 yet, either.  5. Packaging... The IMP1000\\'s packaging is much classier than the IMP880\\'s. Apple has set a very high standard in this regard. Apple customers expect a great \\\\\\\\\"out of box experience\\\\\\\\\", and the IMP1000 won\\'t leave them with a bad first impression. The internal packaging didn\\'t self-destruct from the inside out, as my IMP880\\'s packaging did.    Cons: (please note that many of these are personal opinion)    1. Size and weight... Yes, it has higher capacity than its predecessor, but the trade-off between size and weight with current LiPo technology may have been reached with the IMP1000. Only time and user feedback will tell. I\\'m personally fine with the IMP1000; other users may not be.  2. Blue LED lighting... The trend today with both home and personal electronics seems to be bright, obnoxiously-glitzy LED power and status indicators, usually in blue. The capacity LED\\'s are fine, but the power indicator is bright enough to light up an entire unlit room, much less the inside of a car at night, and can be very annoying/distracting during use. Small, \\\\\\\\\"pin-point\\\\\\\\\" LED\\'s are sufficient here; I believe many other users will concur.  3. Finish... Yes, it\\'s better than the IMP880\\'s, and shiny (\\\\\\\\\"piano\\\\\\\\\") black is \\\\\\\\\"in\\\\\\\\\" these days... but why not a color-molded-in, matte black finish that hides fingerprints and scuffs, instead? Shiny black products look great when brand new, but never look that good again. Matte black ages much more gracefully.  4. No \\\\\\\\\"DC Out\\\\\\\\\" port... I like the connection flexibility afforded by the IMP880\\'s \\\\\\\\\"DC Out\\\\\\\\\" port. I understand that the similar-appearing \\\\\\\\\"DC In\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"DC Out\\\\\\\\\" ports could be a source of confusion for some users, but the ability to charge two devices simultaneously via the splitter cable is a nice feature. How about supplying a USB splitter cable so we can do the same with the IMP1000 (assuming the pack\\'s safety circuitry would adequately protect against excess discharge rate)?    Review/Suggestions:    I have been using the IMP1000 to power my HTC EVO (\\\\\\\\\"Supersonic\\\\\\\\\") 4G on the Sprint network for nearly a week. This otherwise stellar device is notorious for its one glaring shortcoming--terribly insufficient run-time on its supplied internal battery pack. Having a portable (self-contained) power option like the IMP1000 is, in my opinion, the first (and absolutely essential) accessory any smartphone user should purchase (particularly for Apple devices with non-removable batteries). The simple freedom from running out of power is very liberating. No more searching for an electrical outlet when out to lunch or dinner, or cutting conversations or browsing short as the powermeter plunges through amber, then red, as the device quickly goes belly-up. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to recharge the IMP1000 in the first week\\'s use. The IMP1000\\'s 11000 mAh capacity is 7.3 times the EVO\\'s 1500 mAh, so this certainly stands to reason.    A few suggestions...    1. Market aggressively to non-Apple users. I see you\\'ve started doing this since marketing the IMP880. Most Android smartphones have serious battery capacity issues--get the word out to them!  2. The naming scheme of these products is confusing. Why name an 8900 mAh pack \\\\\\\\\"IMP880\\\\\\\\\", and why name an 11000 mAh pack \\\\\\\\\"IMP1000\\\\\\\\\"? I think it would have made more sense to call them \\\\\\\\\"IMP8900\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"IMP11000\\\\\\\\\", respectively.  3. See points 3 and 4 in \\\\\\\\\"Cons\\\\\\\\\", above.    I am very pleased with the IMP1000 and the improvement it represents over the IMP880. It is well worth its $100 ($80, on sale) price tag, and represents a superior value to carrying spare packs for removable-battery devices (and is the only way to go for Apple users who can\\'t swap packs). On-board extended packs make devices bulkier and usually require special battery doors and cases, which limit options greatly. The IMP1000 is also a superior value because it isn\\'t device-specific.    External packs are the most versatile, convenient, and sensible power solution for mobile devices. When used thoughtfully, such as connecting the pack when not using the device and disconnecting during use if you find the cable annoying, or carrying the pack in an outside pocket such as a jacket, so it can remain connected without carrying in-hand during \\\\\\\\\"emergency\\\\\\\\\" use, external packs are simply the \\\\\\\\\"way to go\\\\\\\\\". The IMP1000 breaks new ground for capacity and convenience--highly recommended!\\nI read David\\'s review and agree with his analysis. I also own the IMP880, and have given the IMP500 as gifts. These battery packs are all great, just pick the size/capacity you need. The IMP1000 is certainly the simplest to use, and has the most capacity. The directions are well-written, and have tips for prolonging the life of the battery. 5 Stars.\\nThe IMP1000 has to be the best product out there for mobile phone users and iPad users.  My partner and I decided to take a road trip to the Grand Canyon for a couple days.  We figured it would be a great time to test this battery pack to see if it lived up to the technical details that we\\'d read about.  She has a Blackberry phone, I have an iPhone and iPad.  We took them all out and headed for the road.  Each of our products could be charged with only one external battery piece (the IMP1000).  The convenience of this feature while traveling is obvious. This handy little peripheral is amazing!  Instead of having to carry with us 3 different chargers, we only needed this one.  I truly am a person who loves efficient, multi-use products.  True to its description, it will charge the most popular phone/iPad products and boost battery life exponentially.  It is a NECESSITY for people who travel often.  This is the only product you will need and you will not have a worry even if you have an international flight with layovers.  It gets you there and still has a lot of life left!  Excellent product.  I have purchased other products by New Trent, and I have been 100% satisfied with this top notch company and their customer service.\\nI just received my IMP1000 from New Trent earlier this week. I was looking for a reliable way to easily charge my iphone and ipad when traveling, especially on long flights.  This seems to be the device to bring along.  I recently flew overseas with their IMP880 and it performed wonderfully.  I was looking for a bit greater capacity though, because I use both an iphone (was the 3g, now the 4) and the ipad, and wanted to be able to charge both of them when I don\\'t have access to an electrical outlet.    The unit\\'s size is great for traveling. It\\'s about the same size and weight of a portable hard drive, which these days means it\\'s small and will easily slip into a briefcase, overnight bag, purse, etc.  The retractable cord makes it easy to hook up with the mobile device without any strain on the connections.  The unit\\'s indicator light is simple to see and determine the amount of charge remaining. While charging the unit itself those lights let you know the progress.  And after charging a mobile device, the unit slows down to a trickle charge.    The placement of the button is an improvement over New Trents IMP880, which I also own.  That button could accidentally be turned on because it actually protrudes a bit from the case, and sits at an angle.  The IMP1000\\'s is flush with the case\\'s edge, and the button itself a bit recessed which should prevent that from happening.    I haven\\'t drained the power from a full charge yet, so not sure how long it lasts, but after topping off my iphone and ipad a few times, it still shows a full charge. Of course you can use the device while it\\'s charging.    The IMP1000 comes with iphone/ipad adapter, along with a few others (mini usb, etc).      Good design, seems well built, and I know from past experience with New Trent\\'s customer support that they are very responsive.  Recommend you give it a try if you need a back up battery.\\nThis battery looks and feels lighter than the OEM 1500mAh battery. I was skeptical about it really extending the life of the phone, but after following all the directions about conditioning the battery- it turned out great. On the initial charge, you should leave the phone on charge until the LED turns green, and leave it that was for at least 3 hours. This is a critical step which I feel most reviewers here skipped. I let mine charge all night before use. Then I went through 5 heavy drain and recharge cycles as per the instructions. Now, with normal charging and use, I take the Evo off charge at 6am, and at 7 pm I have between 30 and 40% life left. I am a heavy user, meaning  WIFI on all day at work, GPS always on, Youtube for an hour or so, Google maps, LOTS of internet browsing (which is also part of my job and various other things. Additionally it is in a very warm environment, which is tough on batteries. My OEM battery would die everyday at about 3-4pm. If I run the phone hard until it dies on the Seidio battery, I can get about 14 hours of heavy usage from fully charged.     Pros: 40 bucks well spent (although the phone should have included this battery :)    Cons: SHIPPING FROM AMAZON!! It took 3 WEEKS............ WEEKS....... To get it in US Priority Mail. This was AMAZON.COM\\'s fault 100%, as they failed to ship the battery for nearly two weeks after I paid for it. This is NOT excusable. When I called about the problem, I was told I should have paid for better shipping instead of taking advantage of their \\\\\\\\\"Super Saver Shipping.\\\\\\\\\" Now why offer a service if the people offering it say that if you use it, you are the lowest priority customer? Thanks for nothing, Amazon.\\nI love my new HTC Incredible smartphone, but was not crazy about how I had to be careful about power management all the time.  Turn this off, that off, remember to turn them on.  A couple weeks ago, I went on a hike with the My Tracks GPS pathing software running and within a couple hours was down to about half capacity.Last week, the Innocell arrived.  As other commenters have noted, adding this battery to your phone definitely adds to the heft and bulk.  On the other hand, this can be a good thing.  With the camera lens set back and more case to grip, I\\'ve stopped photographing my left forefinger.  I also think the lens is better protected from scratches, too.As for the replacement back cover, it feels exactly the same as the OEM one, as far as materials go -- no sense this is a cheaper cover or not meant to belong on the phone.  It snapped in as securely as the original and has the same matte non-slip feel to it.Using the JuicePlotter app, I\\'ve noticed no abnormal heating of the battery when charging or using it.The instructions recommend several charge cycles before the battery achieves maximum efficiency, but I\\'m only getting around to doing that now -- and have discovered this thing just won\\'t quit.  I have left WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, G3 and synchronization all turned on, have been using the phone normally, made a few calls, went on another 4 hour tracked hike, watched a few YouTube vids, showed off Google Maps at a friend\\'s house over dinner (an hour or two of heavy GPS-ing and mapping demo-mode), did some browsing, monitored the local weather... I took it off the charger last Thursday morning.  It\\'s now Monday evening and I still have 16% charge left.  That\\'s nearly four and a half DAYS, without even conditioning the battery or making the least attempt to conserve power.I\\'m very happy with this battery.On update, 8/1/10: The 4 1/2 day capacity for me wasn\\'t a fluke. Second go, I took the phone off the charger the morning of July 27th, used it normally the next few days including a GPS tracked hike.  WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth all left on, screen brightness on automatic.  The phone didn\\'t pester me to put it back on the charger until late last night, July 31st.2nd update: 8/6/10: More than five days since last charge, 30% capacity left.3rd update: 8/22/10: Deliberately exercising this battery the last few weeks, the most I\\'ve gotten out of this battery has been 7 days, until it started beeping for the charger; at that point it was around 12% by time I heard it. On a couple heavy-use cycles (lots of talking, GPS tracked hiking, on-highway navigation, photography, non-G3 coverage areas, extra data usage, YouTube viewing and web-surfing while bored in a waiting room, that sort of thing), I have yet to go less than 3 1/2 days.  Average for me has been around 5 1/2 days between charges.4th update: 11/15/10:  It\\'s been nearly four months since I got this battery and it\\'s still running like a champ.  Most of the time, I go about 3-4 days between charges, not because the phone is out, but just because it\\'s convenient.  I continue to be very, very happy I bought this battery.used it normally the next few days including a GPS tracked hike.  WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth all left on, screen brightness on automatic.  The phone didn\\'t pester me to put it back on the charger until late last night, July 31st.    2nd update: 8/6/10: More than five days since last charge, 30% capacity left.    3rd update: 8/22/10: Deliberately exercising this battery the last few weeks, the most I\\'ve gotten out of this battery has been 7 days, until it started beeping for the charger; at that point it was around 12% by time I heard it.

I continue to be very, very happy I bought this battery.\\nThis is truly the extended battery we\\'ve all been waiting for.     Build quality on the battery door is superior to the original, and it\\'s also a much better design.  Tighter fit, great feel. Additionally, it also serves to keep the camera lens from touching the surface the phone is sitting on.     The battery itself is a beast.  I\\'ve had it now for 3 days, and it easily goes 100% over the stock battery.  Last night, I was trying to run the battery down to wipe stats and calibrate it (Custom ROM, etc), and I couldn\\'t get it to die. :P     IMO, I believe you could easily be looking @ 36-48 hours of heavy usage on this one before it finally needs a recharge.      Highly recommended.\\nFinally my battery arrived. Because of the horrible standard battery life I was still skeptical on this one. The instructions say that the full potential of the battery will be after 5-6 full charges but I have charged it 1 full charge so far last night. Took the phone off the charger at 8am, it is not 8:30 pm and my battery is at 74%! I do about 500 texts a day, email, about 18 gigs of internet a month and this looks like finally will handle that. I have listened to Pandora radio for about 1 hour as well and have the screen bright and 4g on just to try and drain it so I can get it dead and charge it tonight. Looks like I wont be able to kill it for a few more hours. Maybe I\\'ll leave Pandora running turn on wifi and gps and let it sit till it dies. Because of the shape of the back cover it is still pretty slim, actually feels better when holding to my ear to talk as well. Great product so far. Might even last two days after fully conditioned on heavy usage.\\nMy new battery came Friday, and has already increased my phone\\'s usefulness by a good hour or so, which is exactly what it is designed to do. Perfect! I find this battery has the oomph needed to make it through the day without having to turn off every little thing, which is nice.. I bought my Incredible to use, not to disable everything it\\'s capable of to save battery!    Here\\'s what I mean about managing your expectations, explained in very simplified terms. The original battery is rated at 1300mAh, and gets you about 3 to 3.5 hours of heavy use.. Surfing, IM\\'ing, etc - all constant use. We\\'ll split the diff and say 3 1/4 hours. So take the 1300 and divide by 3.25, you get 400. So the phone requires about 400 per hour of usage. The new battery is rated 1750mAh.. Divide that out to get hours, and it works like this: 1750/400= about 4.37. Essentially, you get about one more hour of active usage from this battery. Simplified, but that\\'s about how it works. So if you found a magic battery that did 2500mAh, you could figure out how long it would last (2500/400= about 6.25 hours constant usage).    In a nutshell, smartphones like those in the Droid family need more power than other phones. Definitely expect to charge it at least daily. This battery should help get through the day, but it can\\'t perform miracles or break the laws of physics. ;)\\nI had my doubts about how this product would actually work and if it would allow me to charge my Iphone3GS because Apple has made its phone series very picky about chargers.  I can safely say that this product charges WITHOUT forcing the popup about being a non-standard charger.  The unit itself its quite small and I have it attached to the windshield of my car with the included suction cups.  I\\'m using it to charge up my phone while running the Navigation and Traffic Apps (which really drain the phone). Overall I would rate it 5 stars and I\\'m considering purchasing another for additional devices that I could carry with me on trips.\\nPurchased here on Amazon, it charges via the included ipod cable and also has a USB out port for charging anything else that has a USB enabled charger.  Charged my droid from 30% to 100% in about an hour and that was even in cloudy conditions.  Status lights show when it is receiving enough light to create charge and another status light shows when it is charging the connected device.  It will even hold a charge like a battery so you can leave it in the sun to charge up then bring it in and connect it to your device.  I may buy another!\\nI bought this battery direct from Amazon.  I do not trust the 3rd party sellers; none of whom appear to be authorized Motorola resellers.  Counterfeit cell phone batteries are widely available for cheap prices, but who knows what quality you are getting.  Cell phones have been known to catch fire or explode and manufacturers usually blame counterfeit batteries.  The battery that I received from Amazon appears identical to the battery that came with my Motorola Droid phone, including the hologram labeling that is printed on the bottom of the battery.My Droid can last a whole day on one charge if I use only the phone features.  If I use the internet or media or GPS features heavily, then the battery can last less than 8 hours.  Fortunately, the Droid does allow you to easily pop in a spare battery.\\nI purchased the OtterBox Defender Case for my 3GS, then purchased one for my friend\\'s 3GS after having such exceptional experience with it.He is a paramedic / fireman and unintentionally abuses his phones because they sit on his hip and he moves around a lot against huge pieces of metal.  The night I brought the OtterBox case to him at the station he was getting out of the back of their new (very high up) ambulance and the iPhone fell from the holster (he had it horizontal and it caught on the door on his way out).  It fell over 6\\' onto a concrete floor and was absolutely perfect.Though I hadn\\'t dropped my phone in the case up to that point when I saw the fall his phone took I knew I picked the right case.  I haven\\'t experienced any of the issues with tunneling or echo, but I tend to use the headphones or my Jawbone for calls.  The only negative I\\'ve found, and it isn\\'t really a negative but you must use OEM cables that have rounded edges because generic square edged cables will not fit into the charging area of the case.*** For the Oil Slick Issue *** - You\\'ll need a can of air, a lint free cloth (face cloth or sock), a screen protector (optional), and some baby powder. - Take your OtterBox case out of the packaging and put around a teaspoon worth of baby powder (or talc) onto the inside of the window of the hard part of the case, this seems very odd but trust me it works. - Swish the baby powder around until it coats the entire window of the front of the case.  It should look dusted white. - Dump off the excess. - Use the can of air to blow out as much as you can. - Finally, use the cloth to wipe everything clean. - When you\\'re done it will look like you didn\\'t do anything.  You may have a wee bit of residual baby powder here and there inside the case but don\\'t worry about it.Once you\\'re done wiping the case off clean your phone front and back to get it nice and smooth and put the screen protector on, this is a nice additional layer of protection but it isn\\'t necessary.Now put the phone in the case.Once you seal it all up you\\'ll see that there is no oil slick effect and no powder residue.Works perfectly every time.onal layer of protection but it isn\\'t necessary.    Now put the phone in the case.      Once you seal it all up you\\'ll see that there is no oil slick effect and no powder residue.    Works perfectly every time.\\nI am not usually one to leave review comments... but I certainly read a BUNCH of reviews on cases for my iPhone 3G.  THANK YOU to all those who wrote reviews and helped me pick the Otterbox Defender case!  This case is awesome.  VERY durable, all functions are accessible... and yes, the oil slicking effect is sometimes present, but easily fixed.The ONLY issue I had when I installed the case was that immediately after I installed the case, almost 95% of all people I talked to said they heard an echo every time they spoke (you know, when you say something and a second later you hear it in your ear piece... ANNOYING!).I was bummed because the case is built like a tank and already saved my phone from a 6\\' drop onto the asphalt in the rain.  Though, I decided to remove the felt pieces that cover the mic and ear pieces since they are only there to prevent possible drops of water hitting those phone components directly.  Once I removed those pieces, not one person complains of hearing the echo anymore!  Strange, but it worked... so I wanted to pass it on.The echo was the ONLY issue I had with this case... it\\'s the best case I could find and WELL worth the money.  I recommend it to everyone I see with an iPhone now :-)\\nI love my Iphone 3G.  It seems every day I find something new it can do.  But all the function comes with a price - really lousy battery life.  The darn thing drains like a sieve when I use wireless - which is a pain as that is often the fastest connection and offers the best flexibility when using all those fantastic Apps.So I started to hunt down external batteries - especially for those long flights when I was in the middle of an audio book or new series of TV shows and blimmpppp there goes the battery.  The first one I tried cost me $80 and never got to a full charge on the  Iphone, only giving me an additional 3 hours of battery- big whoop - I still couldn\\'t make it overseas.  I tried another that promised 20 hours but it actually drained the Iphone!!!  So imagine my surprise to find this Tecyer that cost half the price and charges like a champ!  It is a fast charge too.  I can\\'t say how long it lasts but I have gone past 25 hours using video and audio and it hasn\\'t run out.  It got me back and forth across the country, over to Germany and France and now I plan to take it to South America.  I highly recommend this unit.  It is slightly smaller than the Iphone and lighter, and because it doesn\\'t connect directly onto the Iphone but through a cord I can keep the phone in its case.As for the Kindle - it has a great battery life, but it is great to have a backup should you forget to charge it. I read about this trick on a Kindle blog - and I bought the USB Sync Charge Cable (for Palm Zire 31 72 Tungsten E) and I now use this adapter cable to connect to the battery pack and it successfully charges my kindle! I love it when I get multifunction out of a unit!\\nThis device is fantastic. Just as it\\'s description says it can charge and power any mobile device that can use USB as a power source. I\\'ve used it with my iPod, PSP, Nintendo DS, and even my GPS and it works beautifully.  Before I got it, I was expecting something larger and heavier that didn\\'t hold it\\'s charge as well as this does. I should have known better. All of the APC products that I use at home and at work are great and this is no exception to that rule. It easily fits into a pants pocket or a small bag that you might use to carry your other devices.  What has impressed me the most is how well it can hold it\\'s charge when it\\'s not in use. Other portable batteries I have tried usually get pretty drained rather quickly when sitting on a shelf or being carried around. I\\'ve gone weeks without using this and it still had a full charge when I needed it. That was a life saver. We were lost in another state and the battery in my GPS was almost dead. The UPB10 got us home with power to spare.  I haven\\'t been able to test how much time it can add to my various devices, because it lasts longer than I have needed it so far. On a weekend it looks like I got an additional four hours on the PSP. I could have gone longer, but I ran out of time to use it. That was while using it when watching a movie on the memory stick and playing a game from a UMD disc. I was also using my GRADO headphones at a good volume level.  I have noticed that some people have commented that the PSP can\\'t be charged from a USB cable. This is only true if you don\\'t have the right kind of cable. There are several manufacturers that make a USB cable with an extra wire that plugs into the power port on a PSP. MadCatz even makes a retractable one that I use because it makes everything even more portable. There is also a similar cable for the Nintendo DS, which otherwise couldn\\'t be powered by USB.   The UPB10 may seem a bit pricey at first, butwith it\\'s versatility and performance, to me it was worth every penny.'"
